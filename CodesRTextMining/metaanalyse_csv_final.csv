"Soil chemistry turned upside down: a meta-analysis of invasive earthworm effects on soil chemical properties","Olga Ferlian","Nico Eisenhauer","Recent studies have shown that invasive earthworms can dramatically reduce native biodiversity, both above and below the ground. However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta‐analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base‐rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapotranspiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta‐analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, for example, shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta‐analyses.","Ecology (Ecological Society of Amercica)","en",2020,"Aug","Germany","Germany","10.1002/ecy.2936","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2936","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Various","ammonium;earthworm ecological group;element flux;exotic earthworms;nitrate;nitrification;nitrogen;nutrient cycling;pH;phosphorus;soil carbon;water content ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effect of earthworm addition on soil nitrogen availability, microbial biomass and litter decomposition in mesocosms.","Yelinda Araujo","Eleusa Barros","The aim of the study was to determine the effect of adding two tropical earthworm species, Rhinodrilus contortus and Pontoscolex corethrurus, to mesocosms on the availability of mineral N (NH4 + and NO3 − concentrations), soil microbial biomass (bio-N), and the decomposition rates of three contrasting leaf litter species, in a glasshouse experiment. The mesocosms were filled with forest soil and covered with a layer of leaf litter differing in nutritional quality: (1) Hevea brasiliensis (C/N=27); (2) Carapa guianensis (C/N=32); (3) Vismia sp., the dominant tree species in the second growth forest (control, C/N= 42); and, (4) a mixture of the former three leaf species, in equal proportions (C/N=34). At the end of the 97-day experiment, the soil mineral N concentrations, bio-N, and leaf litter weight loss were determined. Both earthworm species showed significant effects on the concentrations of soil NO3 − (p0.01) and NH4 + (p0.05). Bio-N was always greater in the mesocosms with earthworms (especially with R. contortus) and in the mesocosms with leaf litter of H. brasiliensis (6 µg N g−1 soil), the faster decomposing species, than in the other treatments (0.1–1.6 µg N g−1). Thus, earthworm activity increased soil mineral-N concentrations, possibly due to the consumption of soil microbial biomass, which can speed turnover and mineralization of microbial tissues. No significant differences in decomposition rate were found between the mesocosms with and without earthworms, suggesting that experiments lasting longer are needed to determine the effect of earthworms on litter decomposition rates.","Biology and fertility of soils ","en",2003,"Jan","Venezuela","Brazil","10.1007/s00374-003-0696-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-003-0696-0  ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Brazil","Amazonia","Earthworms;Nitrogen mineralization;Litter decomposition process;Amazonia","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"A review of earthworm impact on soil function and ecosystem services.","M. Blouin","J.‐J. Brun","Biodiversity is responsible for the provision of many ecosystem services; human well‐being is based on these services, and consequently on biodiversity. In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed ‘ecosystem engineers’. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate.

"Ecosystem consequences of exotic earthworm invasion of north temperate forests.","Patrick J. Bohlen","Robert T. Fahey","The invasion of north temperate forests by exotic species of earthworms is an important issue that has been overlooked in the study and management of these forests. We initiated research to address the hypothesis that earthworm invasion will have large consequences for nutrient retention and uptake in these ecosystems. In this special feature of Ecosystems, we present five papers describing results from our experiment. In this paper, we (a) introduce our experimental approach and conceptual model of how earthworms influence forest ecosystem processes, (b) describe the characteristics of the study areas and earthworm communities at our two study locations, and (c) provide a brief overview and synthesis of the main findings. The most dramatic effect of earthworm invasion was the loss of the forest floor at an undisturbed forest site, which altered the location and nature of nutrient cycling activity in the soil profile. Invasion changed soil total carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) pools, carbon–nitrogen (C:N) ratios, the loss and distribution of different soil P fractions, and the distribution and function of roots and microbes. Response to invasion varied with site characteristics and earthworm species. Our results suggest that exotic earthworm invasion is a significant factor that will influence the structure and function of northern temperate forest ecosystems over the next few decades. Regional evaluations of these forests will need to consider the presence or absence of earthworms along with other important ecosystem drivers, such as pollution, climate, and underlying soil characteristics.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0126-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0126-z","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York state","exotic species;invasions;carbon;nitrogen;phosphorus;roots;nutrient cycling;forest","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Non-native invasive earthworms as agents of change in northern temperate forests.","Patrick J. Bohlen","D. Parkinson","Exotic earthworms from Europe and Asia are invading many northern forests in North America that currently lack native earthworms, providing an opportunity to assess the role of this important group of invertebrates in forest ecosystems. Research on earthworm invasions has focused on changes in soil structure and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling that occur following invasion. These changes include the mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons, decreases in soil C storage, and equivocal effects on N cycling. Less well studied are changes in the soil foodwebs that accompany earthworm invasion. Soils of north temperate forests harbor a tremendous diversity of microorganisms and invertebrates, whose distribution and abundance can be substantially altered by earthworm invasion. Furthermore, invasive earthworms can affect understory plant communities, raising concerns over the loss of rare native herbs in some areas. The ecological consequences of earthworm invasion are mediated through physical, geochemical, and biological effects. These effects vary with different earthworm species, as well as with the characteristics of the site being invaded. Earthworm invasions may have important interactions with other rapid changes predicted for northern forests in the coming decades, including climate and land-use change, increased nutrient deposition, and other biological invasions.","Frontiers in Ecology and Environnement","en",2004,"Oct","USA","Belgium","10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0427:NIEAAO]2.0.CO;2","https://doi.org/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0427:NIEAAO]2.0.CO;2","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Northern forests, North America.","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Protection of soil carbon by microaggregates within earthworm casts.","Heleen Bossuyt","Paul F. Hendrix","Earthworms are known to play a role in aggregate formation and soil organic matter (SOM) protection. However, it is still unclear at what scale and how quickly earthworms manage to protect SOM. We investigated the effects of Aporrectodea caliginosa on aggregation and aggregate-associated C pools using 13C-labeled sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) leaf residue. Two incubations were set up. The first incubation consisted of soil samples crushed &lt;250 μm to break up all macroaggregates with three treatments: (i) control soil; (ii) soil+13C-labeled residue and (iii) soil+13C-labeled residue+earthworms. Earthworms were added after 8 d and 12 d (days) later, aggregate size distribution was measured together with total C and 13C in each aggregate fraction. A second incubation was made to assay protected versus unprotected total C and 13C from 21-d laboratory incubations of intact and crushed large (&gt;2000 μm) and small (250–2000 μm) macroaggregates and microaggregates (53–250 μm). Eight different pools of aggregate-associated C were quantified: (1) and (2) unprotected C pools in large and small macroaggregates, (3) unprotected C pools in microaggregates, (4) and (5) protected C pools in large and small macroaggregates, (6) protected C pool in microaggregates, and (7) and (8) protected C pools in microaggregates within large and small macroaggregates. In the presence of earthworms, a higher proportion of large macroaggregates was newly formed and these aggregates contained more C and 13C compared to bulk soil. There were no significant differences between the samples with or without earthworms in the C pool-sizes protected by macroaggregates, microaggregates or microaggregates within small macroaggregates. However, in the presence of earthworms, the C protected by microaggregates within large macroaggregates was a significant pool and 22% of this C pool was newly added C. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the direct involvement of earthworms in providing protection of soil C in microaggregates within large macroaggregates leading to a possible long-term stabilization of soil C.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2005,"Feb","Belgium","Georgia","10.1016/j.soilbio.2004735"," https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.07.035 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Greece","Horseshoe Bend, near Athens","Aggregation;Microaggregates;Carbon;Earthworms;Carbon protection","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Strategies lombriciennes","M. B. Bouché","M. B. Bouché","An earthworm classification in ecological categories based on morphological features (organs showing functional adaptations) on spatial distribution, on soil humidity and on feeding habits was introduced in 1969 for didactic reasons. Subsequently, this classification has proved to be a powerful tool of ecological synthesis. It distinguishes three extreme types of adaptative evolution (endogeous forms, epigeous forms, anecics); their definitions are completed. They are three poles between which earthworms could be put in order. According to the past (which involves some evolutionary ways), and the level of adaptation into a site (new or old settelments) there is congruence between earthworm features (feeding habits, reproduction, extreme factor resistances, mobility, size, respiration, demography, behaviour, predator pressures, etc.) and their environment (available niches, food, humidity, etc.). Ecological categories are the traduction of evolutionary earthworm strategies and all bioecological features. The morpho-functional interpretation, always feasible, and some ecological, biological, physiological measurements made in favorable circumstances validate this classification. This holistic classification provides the opportunity to judge the relative adaptation of a monospecific local population to its environment. Among such adaptations a new making of resistance of earthworms is described: the ""enkystment"" by cocoons.","Ecological Bulletins","fr",1977,"N/A","France","France","10.1016/0012-8252(87)90008-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-8252(87)90008-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","France","France","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"How do earthworms affect microfloral and faunal community diversity?","George G. Brown","George G. Brown","Much of the work regarding earthworm effects on other organisms has focused on the functional significance of microbial-earthworm interactions, and little is known on the effects of earthworms on microfloral and faunal diversity. Earthworms can affect soil microflora and fauna populations directly and indirectly by three main mechanisms: (1) comminution, burrowing and casting; (2) grazing; (3) dispersal. These activities change the soil's physico-chemical and biological status and may cause drastic shifts in the density, diversity, structure and activity of microbial and faunal communities within the drilosphere. Certain organisms and species may be enhanced, reduced or not be affected at all depending on their ability to adapt to the particular conditions of different earthworm drilospheres. A large host of factors (including CaCO3, enzymes, mucus and antimicrobial substances) influence the ability of preferentially or randomly ingested organisms to survive (or not) passage through the earthworm gut, and their resultant capacity to recover and proliferate (or not) in earthworm casts. Small organisms, particularly microflora and microfauna, with limited ability to move within the soil, may benefit from the (comparatively) long ranging movements of earthworms. Microflora and smaller fauna appear to be particularly sensitive to earthworm activities, and priming effects enhancing nutrient release, particularly in casts, are common. Larger fauna such as microarthropods, enchytraeids and Isopods may be enhanced under some conditions (e.g., in earthworm middens), but in other cases earthworm activity may lead to a decrease in their populations due to competition for food (microbes and organic materials), and spatial and temporal changes in food abundance. Nevertheless, considering the presently available data, the beneficial interactions of earthworms and microflora and fauna appear to far outweigh the potential negative effects. However, much is still unknown regarding the interactions of earthworms of different ecological categories on the diversity and function of microfloral and faunal communities, and much more interdisciplinary research is needed to assess the potential role of earthworms in regulating the diversity of microflora and fauna in soil systems and the potentially beneficial or harmful effects this regulation may have on ecosystem function and plant growth in different ecosystems.","Plant and soil ","en",1995,"Jan","Brazil ","Brazil ","10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, E LANSING, MI","diversity;earthworms;soil fauna;soil microflora;soil processes","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Carbon and nitrogen mobilisation by earthworms of different functional groups as affected by soil sand content.","O. Butenschoen","S. Scheu","Earthworms play an important role in organic matter processing and nutrient cycling in temperate ecosystems. It is known that earthworms preferentially ingest sand grains mixed with organic material and it has been suggested that the mixture of sand and organic material during the gut passage may play an important role in litter degradation and nutrient release, which may accelerate assimilation of nutrients by earthworms and likely enhance plant growth. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the effect of the anecic earthworm species emLumbricus terrestris and the endogeic earthworm species emOctolasion tyrtaeum separately and in combination on carbon and nitrogen mobilisation from surface applied rye litter labelled with 13 and 15. By mixing arable soil with 25% sand, we investigated the effect of the availability of sand. To quantify the mobilisation of 15N, three rye seedlings were planted in each microcosm and analysed for isotope signature after 3 months of incubation. Mobilisation of 13C was quantified by analysing the incorporation of label into the soil and earthworm tissue.Irrespective of the addition of sand the biomass of emL. terrestris decreased during the experiment, whereas that of emO. tyrtaeum increased in single species treatment and slightly decreased in the combined treatment with emL. terrestris. The concentration of 13C decreased while that of 15N increased in the tissue of both earthworm species, with the effect being more pronounced in emL. terrestris for 13C and in emO. tyrtaeum for 15N. Both earthworm species increased shoot biomass, with the effect of emL. terrestris (+80%) exceeding that of emO. tyrtaeum (+28%) and maximum plant biomass in the combined treatment (+92%). Earthworms did not affect the 15N concentration of rye plants, but sand significantly increased 15N concentration of plants, presumably due to improving soil structure. Overall, the incorporation of 13C into the soil was low and was significantly increased in presence of sand, with the highest enrichment in treatments without earthworms.The results indicate that the availability of sand does not increase effects of earthworms on litter degradation, nutrient release and plant growth. Rather, independent of soil sand content earthworms increase plant growth, whereas the presence of sand itself enhances the uptake of nitrogen from plant litter and the incorporation of litter carbon into the soil.","Pedobiologia","en",2009,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.1101","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.11.001","10.1002/ecy.2936","Germany","Bad Lauchstädt","Stable isotopes;Soil organic matter;N-mobilisation;Lumbricidae ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Burrow systems of endogeic earthworms: Effects of earthworm abundance and consequences for soil water infiltration.","Yvan Capowiez","Eric Michel","By creating burrows, earthworms influence the transfer properties of soils. The effects of endogeic species on soil transfer properties, however, are not yet well understood because these earthworms generally create burrows that are refilled by casts and have no preferential vertical orientation. Thirty soil cores were incubated for various periods (1-3 or 4 weeks) at different earthworm densities (70, 210,345 or 480 individuals m(-2)). The cores were then scanned using X-ray tomography and the burrow systems were characterised by measuring the total burrow volume, bioturbation volume (refilled burrows and lateral compaction around the burrows), the number of branches, tortuosity and continuity (assessed by computing the number of burrows with a vertical extension greater than 15, 20 and 25% of the core). We also computed the mean geodesic distance, i.e. the mean distance from the bottom to the top of the core assuming that distances inside burrows are null. Rainfall simulations were carried out on 17 cores chosen to encompass the variations observed in the burrow systems. The water transfer efficiency of each core was estimated by measuring two parameters: breakthrough volume and the percentage of water transmitted after 1 h of rain. Burrow and bioturbation volume increased significantly and steadily with time and earthworm density. We estimated that on average Allolobophora chlororica burrowed 22 cm per week. All other burrow system characteristics also increased with time and earthworm density except the mean geodesic distance, which decreased significantly. This suggests that intraspecific interactions had no significant effect on burrow system geometry. Univariate PLS regressions were used to understand which burrow system characteristics had the strongest influence on water transfer. These regressions showed that the mean geodesic distance was the most important parameter. This means that in addition to individual burrow characteristics, the spatial arrangement of the whole burrow system also had a major effect on transfer properties.

"Non-native earthworms in riparian soils increase nitrogen flux into adjacent aquatic ecosystems.","David M. Costello","Gary A. Lamberti","Riparian zones are an important transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and they function in nutrient cycling and removal. Non-native earthworms invading earthworm-free areas of North America can affect nutrient cycling in upland soils and have the potential to affect it in riparian soils. We examined how the presence of earthworms can affect riparian nutrient cycling and nutrient delivery to streams. Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to determine how (1) the biomass of earthworms and (2) earthworm species can affect nutrient flux from riparian zones to nearby streams and how this flux can affect streamwater nutrients and periphyton growth. In separate experiments, riparian soil cores were amended with one of four mixed earthworm biomasses (0, 4, 10, or 23 g m⁻² ash-free dry mass) or with one of three earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Lumbricus terrestris, L. rubellus) or no earthworm species. Riparian soil cores were coupled to artificial streams, and over a 36-day period, we measured nutrient leaching rates, in-stream nutrient concentrations, and periphyton growth. Ammonium leaching increased with increasing biomass and was greatest from the A. caliginosa treatments. Nitrate leaching increased through time and increased at a greater rate with higher biomass and from cores containing A. caliginosa. We suggest that the overall response of increased nitrate leaching [90% of total nitrogen (N)] was due to a combination of ammonium excretion and burrowing by earthworms, which increased nitrification rates. During both experiments, periphyton biomass increased through time but did not differ across treatments despite high in-stream inorganic N. Through time, in-stream phosphorus (P) concentration declined to &lt;5 µg l⁻¹, and periphyton growth was likely P-limited. We conclude that activities of non-native earthworms (particularly A. caliginosa) can alter biogeochemical cycling in riparian zones, potentially reducing the N-buffering capacity of riparian zones and altering stoichiometric relationships in adjacent aquatic ecosystems.","OECOLOGIA","en",2008,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-008-1149-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1149-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Upper Peninsula of Michigan","Invasive species;Lumbricidae;Nitrate;Nitrification;Stream productivity ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Invasion of exotic earthworms into ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms.","P. F. Hendrix","X. Zou","The most conspicuous biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems have been by exotic plants, insects and vertebrates. Invasions by exotic earthworms, although not as well studied, may be increasing with global commerce in agriculture, waste management and bioremediation. A number of cases has documented where invasive earthworms have caused significant changes in soil profiles, nutrient and organic matter dynamics, other soil organisms or plant communities. Most of these cases are in areas that have been disturbed (e.g., agricultural systems) or were previously devoid of earthworms (e.g., north of Pleistocene glacial margins). It is not clear that such effects are common in ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms, especially where soils are undisturbed. We explore the idea that indigenous earthworm fauna and/or characteristics of their native habitats may resist invasion by exotic earthworms and thereby reduce the impact of exotic species on soil processes. We review data and case studies from temperate and tropical regions to test this idea. Specifically, we address the following questions: Is disturbance a prerequisite to invasion by exotic earthworms? What are the mechanisms by which exotic earthworms may succeed or fail to invade habitats occupied by native earthworms? Potential mechanisms could include (1) intensity of propagule pressure (how frequently and at what densities have exotic species been introduced and has there been adequate time for proliferation?); (2) degree of habitat matching (once introduced, are exotic species faced with unsuitable habitat conditions, unavailable resources, or unsuited feeding strategies?); and (3) degree of biotic resistance (after introduction into an otherwise suitable habitat, are exotic species exposed to biological barriers such as predation or parasitism, ‘‘unfamiliar’’ microflora, or competition by resident native species?). Once established, do exotic species coexist with native species, or are the natives eventually excluded? Do exotic species impact soil processes differently in the presence or absence of native species? We conclude that (1) exotic earthworms do invade ecosystems inhabited by indigenous earthworms, even in the absence of obvious disturbance; (2) competitive exclusion of native earthworms by exotic earthworms is not easily demonstrated and, in fact, co-existence of native and exotic species appears to be common, even if transient; and (3) resistance to exotic earthworm invasions, if it occurs, may be more a function of physical and chemical characteristics of a habitat than of biological interactions between native and exotic earthworms.

The global distribution of a few species (e.g., Pontoscolex corethrurus) was noted by early naturalists, but now approximately 120 such peregrine species are recognized to be widespread from regional to global scales, mainly via human activities. Species adapted to human transport and to colonization of disturbed habitats are most widespread and are the principal invasive species. We identify a number of endogenous and exogenous factors that may contribute to the successful establishment and spread of peregrine species. Quantification of these factors may help to determine why certain species become invasive while others do not.

Here, we relate rates of gross N mineralisation to fungi-to-bacteria ratios in three natural forest types of contrasting N availability and in a long-term N-loading experiment in a boreal forest. We report, for the first time, a strong negative correlation between gross N mineralisation and the fungi-to-bacteria ratio ( R²adj= 0.91, P = 0.0005, N = 7). There was also a negative correlation between gross N mineralisation and the C-to-N ratio (R²adj = 0.89, P = 0.001, N = 7), but a weaker positive correlation between gross N mineralisation and soil pH ( R²adj= 0.64, P = 0.019, N = 7).

"Influence of invasive earthworms on above and belowground vegetation in a northern hardwood forest.","Kristine N. Hopfensperger","Timothy J. Fahey","Scientists are beginning to have a firm grasp on the dramatic influence invasive earthworms can have on nutrient cycling in northern hardwood forests, yet a concrete understanding of their effects on plant communities is still needed. Towards this effort, we examined both the above and belowground plant communities, along with soil organic matter, pH, texture and light in Arnot Forest located in south central New York. Two transects were aligned parallel to previously defined gradients of earthworm density and were sampled in the spring and summer of 2008. We found plots codominated by multiple earthworm species decreased belowground seed abundance and species richness. Aboveground plant cover and diversity along with soil organic matter was lower along the transect with multiple earthworm species. In addition, we found earthworm density increased with soil pH, but did not detect relationships with soil texture or light intensity. Our results were consistent with previous findings of earthworms negatively affecting aboveground plant communities and soil organic matter, and increasing pH. Our study demonstrates the potential for exotic earthworms to dramatically alter forest soil seed banks; however, future research is needed to investigate complexities of earthworm community dynamics (e.g., number and life form of earthworm species) and to tease apart mechanisms responsible for changes in the belowground plant community.","AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST","en",2011,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1674/0003-0031-166.1.53","http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-166.1.53","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Arnot forest, New York","SEED-BANK;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;STANDING VEGETATION;SOIL;TEMPERATE;COLONIZATION;CONSEQUENCES;MORPHOLOGY;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS (keywords+)","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Publication and related biases.","Michael D. Jennions","Hannah R. Rothstein","This chapter discusses the increased occurrence of publication bias in the scientific literature. Publication bias is associated with the inaccurate representation of the merit of a hypothesis or idea. A strict definition is that it occurs when the published literature reports results that systematically differ from those of all studies and statistical tests conducted; the result is that false conclusions are drawn. The chapter presents five main approaches used to either detect potential narrow sense publication bias or assess how sensitive the results of a meta-analysis are to the possible exclusion. These include funnel plots, tests for relationships between effect size and sample size using nonparametric correlation or regression, trim and fill method, fail-safe numbers, and model selection.","Individual book","en",2013,"Apr","Australia","USA","10.23943/princeton/978069113728503014","https://asu.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/publication-and-related-biases","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","N/A","General Mathematics","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Resource stoichiometry and availability modulate species richness and biomass of tropical litter macro-invertebrates.","Malte Jochum","Ulrich Brose","High biodiversity and biomass of soil communities are crucial for litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical forests. However, the leaf litter that these communities consume is of particularly poor quality as indicated by elemental stoichiometry. The impact of resource quantity, quality and other habitat parameters on species richness and biomass of consumer communities is often studied in isolation, although much can be learned from simultaneously studying both community characteristics.Using a dataset of 780 macro‐invertebrate consumer species across 32 sites in tropical lowland rain forest and agricultural systems on Sumatra, Indonesia, we investigated the effects of basal resource stoichiometry (C:X ratios of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S in local leaf litter), litter mass (basal resource quantity and habitat space), plant species richness (surrogate for litter habitat heterogeneity), and soil pH (acidity) on consumer species richness and biomass across different consumer groups (i.e. 3 feeding guilds and 10 selected taxonomic groups).In order to distinguish the most important predictors of consumer species richness and biomass, we applied a standardised model averaging approach investigating the effects of basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and soil pH on both consumer community characteristics. This standardised approach enabled us to identify differences and similarities in the magnitude and importance of such effects on consumer species richness and biomass.Across consumer groups, we found litter mass to be the most important predictor of both species richness and biomass. Resource stoichiometry had a more pronounced impact on consumer species richness than on their biomass. As expected, taxonomic groups differed in which resource and habitat parameters (basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and pH) were most important for modulating their community characteristics.The importance of litter mass for both species richness and biomass indicates that these tropical consumers strongly depend on habitat space and resource availability. Our study supports previous theoretical work indicating that consumer species richness is jointly influenced by resource availability and the balanced supply of multiple chemical elements in their resources.","Journal of animal ecology","en",2017,"Sep","Germany","Germany","10.1111/1365-2656.12695","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12695","10.1002/ecy.2936","Indonesia ","Sumatra","consumer biomass;consumer species richnes;sconsumer-resource interaction;ecological stoichiometry;elemental ratios;model averaging ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Biogeochemistry and the structure of tropical brown food webs.","Michael Kaspari","Stephen P. Yanoviak","Litter invertebrates are notoriously patchy at small scales. Here we show that the abundance of 10 litter taxa also varies 100‐fold at landscape and regional scales across 26 forest stands in Peru and Panama. We contrast three hypotheses that link gradients of abundance to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Of 14 factors considered (12 chemical elements, plus fiber and litter depth), four best predicted the abundance of litter invertebrates. In the Secondary Productivity Hypothesis, phosphorus limits abundance via the conversion of detritus to microbial biomass. Two of four microbivore taxa, collembola and isopods, increased with the percentage of P (%P) of decomposing litter. However, percentage of S (correlated with %P) best predicted the abundance of collembola, oribatids, and diplopods (2= 0.38, 0.33, 0.21, respectively). In the Structural Elements Hypotheses, N and Ca limit the abundance of silk‐spinning and calcareous taxa, respectively. Mesostigmatids, pseudoscorpions, and spiders, all known to make silk, each increased with percentage of N of litter (2= 0.22, 0.31, 0.26, respectively). Calcareous isopods, but not diplopods, increased with percentage of Ca of litter (2= 0.59). In the Ecosystem Size Hypothesis, top predators are limited by available space. The abundance of the three remaining predators, chilopods, staphylinids, and ants, increased with litter depth (2= 0.31, 0.74, 0.69, respectively), and food webs from forests with deeper litter supported a higher ratio of predators to microbivores. These results suggest that biogeochemical gradients can provide a mechanism, through stoichiometry and trophic theory, shaping the geography of community structure.","Ecology ","en",2009,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1890/08-1795.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1795.1","10.1002/ecy.2936","Panama / Peru","Forests / Loreto province (Peru)","calcium decomposition;ecosystem size;invertebrates;litter;nitrogen;phosphorus;stoichiometry;trophic structure;tropical forests ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effect of the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea tuberculata on aggregation and carbon redistribution in uninvaded forest soil columns.","Meghan E. Knowles","Josef H. Görres","The long-term impact of earthworm presence on soil carbon (C) dynamics of previously uninhabited northeastern forests is still largely unknown. Currently, earthworm presence is understood to both enhance soil respiration and create stable microaggregates, processes assumed to have conflicting effects on long term C storage. To date, studies investigating earthworm-created microaggregates and occluded C have rarely been done in undisturbed forest soils. A paired mesocosm study (n = 5) was conducted investigating the impact of the endogeic earthworm species Aporrectodea tuberculata on the physical proportion of microaggregates and the associated mineral soil C of a minimally disturbed forest soil. Pairs analyzed after 4 weeks of incubation demonstrated no significant aggregate effects. At 4 months, paired cores with earthworms (WW) showed a 67% increase in large macroaggregates (2000 μm diameter, lgMA), compared to cores without earthworms (NW). While distribution shifted among various microaggregate pools (free and occluded within macroaggregates), the net proportion of microaggregates in the soil (dry weight basis) was unaltered. After 4 months, the mineral soil of WW cores had an average of 60% more C than the NW cores due to the relocation of the forest floor. The C associated with the microaggregate fractions increased an average of 56%. Of this increase in C, 95% was accounted for by the microaggregates occluded within the lgMA fraction, a fraction that was almost 4 times greater in the WW cores. Over 50% of the C relocated into the mineral soil was associated with the physically protected microaggregate fractions, indicating that though this species of earthworm did not alter the proportion of microaggregates in these soils, they occluded a substantial proportion of C within those physical fractions. In this particular forest soil, the actions of Aporrectodea tuberculata increased the physically protected C pool through microaggregate restructuring and C enrichment.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2016,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.soilbio.2016616","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.016","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Bristol ","Earthworms;Carbon dynamics;Soil aggregation;Microaggregates;Forest soil ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Uses and misuses of meta-analysis in plant ecology.","Julia Koricheva","Jessica Gurevitch","The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.","Journal of Ecology","en",2014,"Jul","UK","USA","10.1111/1365-2745.12224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12224","10.1002/ecy.2936","Not relevant (322 meta-analyses)","Not relevant (322 meta-analyses)","ecophysiology;meta-analysis;methodological quality;plant ecology;research synthesis;systematic review;vote counting ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

We compared mycorrhizal associations of areas of earthworm invasion with those of reference (no-worm) areas in Arnot Forest, central New York, USA.;•; The organic horizon in reference areas had higher mycorrhizal colonization rates and higher colonized root length than did surface layers in areas with active earthworm populations. Hyphal coils were more abundant and also formed a greater proportion of total fungal colonization in reference plots. Vesicles were more abundant and were a higher contribution to total colonization in earthworm plots, indicating a possible stress response to the presence of earthworms.;•; By affecting mycorrhizal colonization and morphology, earthworms may influence nutrient uptake capacity of dominant forest species.

"Greenhouse-gas emissions from soils increased by earthworms.","Ingrid M. Lubbers","J.W.

They are thought to stimulate carbon sequestration in soil aggregates, but also to increase emissions of the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Hence, it remains highly controversial whether earthworms predominantly affect soils to act as a net source or sink of greenhouse gases. Here, we provide a quantitative review of the overall effect of earthworms on the soil greenhouse-gas balance.

Martin","This study aimed to establish the effects of iMillsonia anomala/i, a tropical geophagous earthworm common in the humid savannas of Lamto (Ivory Coast), on soil organic matter dynamics over different time scales under laboratory conditions. The texture of casts produced by the worms fed on a shrub savanna soil was not significantly different from that of the soil, which showed that iM. anomala/i ingested soil particles without selection. Physical fractionation of soil organic matter showed that the coarse organic fraction (250–2000 μm) was depleted by 25–30% in fresh casts compared to the control noningested soil; this was mainly due to a fragmentation of coarse organic debris. Incubation of casts and a 2-mm sieved control soil under laboratory conditions for more than 1 year showed that the C mineralisation rate was almost four times lower in the casts (3% year-1) than in the control soil (11% year-1). We therefore concluded that on a long time scale iM. anomala/i populations may significantly reduce the decomposition rate of soil organic matter in Lamto savannas.","Biology and fertility of soils ","en",1991,"June","France","France","10.1007/bf00335774","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00335774","10.1002/ecy.2936","Ivory Coast","Lamto ","Geophagous tropical earthworm;Soil organic matter;Assimilation;Physical fractionation;Dynamics of organic matter;Tropical savannas;Millsonia anomala ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Here we present three simple  models of interspecific competitive interactions in communities  containing various numbers of randomly chosen species. All three models  predict that, on average, productivity increases asymptotically with  the original biodiversity of a community. The two models that address  plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models.

"Microbial respiration, biomass, biovolume and nutrient status in burrow walls of Lumbricus terrestris L. (Lumbricidae).","Alexei V. Tiunov","Stefan Scheu","Chemical characteristics and microbial activity were studied in burrow walls of the anecic earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris and in control soil of a lime (Tilia cordata), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest. Samples were taken in June and October at distances of 0–4 (drilosphere), 8–12 and 50–60 (control soil) mm from earthworm burrows. The following variables were measured: organic C, total N, moisture, pH, basal respiration, microbial biomass (SIR method), fungal and bacterial volume (epifluorescence microscopy) and nutrient (C, N and P) limitation of microbial growth. Organic C and total N contents increased in the burrow walls by factors of 1.8–3.5 and 1.3–2.2, respectively, compared to the control soil. The moisture content and pH (up to 1.2 units) was higher. Basal respiration, microbial biomass and bacterial volume in the drilosphere exceeded those in control soil significantly by factors of 3.7–9.1, 2.3–4.7 and 2.1–5.4, respectively. Changes in fungal volume with vicinity to burrows differed between forest sites. Fungal volume was increased significantly by factors of 1.9–3.4 in the earthworm burrow walls in the oak and beech forest, but was similar to that in control soil in the lime forest. Microbial growth in the control soil was limited by N in the oak forest and by N and P in the lime and beech forest. The nutrient status of the microflora changed little in vicinity to burrows. However, microbial N and P demand in earthworm burrow walls exceeded that in soil. The specific respiration (qO2) was increased and the growth response to nutrient additions was faster in the burrow walls suggesting that the microbial community in the burrow walls contains a larger fraction of metabolically-active microorganisms, adapted to continuous resource additions by earthworm faeces and mucus. Enrichment in organic matter, but also other mechanisms, particularly the activity of microbivorous soil animals, are presumably responsible for the formation of a specific microbial community in earthworm burrow walls. It is concluded that L. terrestris burrow walls are stable microhabitats which sustain a large and active microbial community and are likely to play an important role in the soil system by regulating microbial-mediated chemical processes.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",1999,"Dec","Russia","Germany","10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00127-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00127-3","10.1002/ecy.2936","Russia / Germany","Moscou / Göttingen","Earthworms;drilosphere;microorganisms;substrate induced respiration;limitation;nitrogen;phosphorus;forest ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Tiunov","Stefan Scheu","Anecic earthworms emLumbricus terrestris L. were kept in laboratory microcosms containing soil and litter from a lime (emTilia cordata) and beech (emFagus sylvatica) forest. Nutrient (mineral nitrogen and phosphorus) contents, microbial activity and densities of protozoa and nematodes were determined in burrow walls and control soils after 165 days. Well-developed burrow linings consisting of earthworm faeces were formed in the “emTilia” treatment, but not in the “emFagus” treatment, presumably because beech litter was not an adequate food resource for emL. terrestris. Consequently, increases in microbial biomass, basal respiration and microbial volume in burrow walls compared to surrounding soil were significant in the “emTilia” treatment only. However, in both treatments burrow walls were strongly enriched in mineral nitrogen and phosphorus. The density and biomass of protozoa were significantly greater in burrow walls compared to the control soil. The numbers of naked amoebae increased by similar factors of 4 and 3.5 in burrow walls of the “emTilia” and “emFagus” treatment, respectively. Flagellate density increased more than tenfold in burrow walls of the “emTilia” treatment but only twofold in the “emFagus” treatment. In addition, a comparatively large ciliate population was present in burrow walls in the “emTilia” treatment. The total abundance of protozoa was significantly correlated with the contents of inorganic N and P in the samples (emr = 0.68 and 0.63 respectively, P&lt; 0.03) suggesting that protozoan grazing participated in the mobilisation of nutrients from microbial biomass. The total nematode density was increased in burrow walls by a factor of 3 in the “emTilia” treatment (mostly due to bacterivorous nematodes), but was not affected in the “emFagus” treatment. In both treatments density of fungivorous nematodes increased, while that of plant parasites decreased in burrow walls compared to the control soil.

"The unseen invaders: introduced earthworms as drivers of change in plant communities in North American forests (a meta-analysis).","Dylan Craven","Nico Eisenhauer","Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning. While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests.

"Factors affecting earthworm abundance in soils.","C. A. Edwards","C. A.

However, within particular climatic zones, earthworm assemblages, with fairly characteristic species richness, composition, abundance, and biomass, can often be recognized in broadly different habitat types, such as coniferous forests, deciduous woodland, grassland, and arable land. There is a considerable volume of literature describing the earthworm communities of such habitats, and much of this was summarized by Lee (1985) and updated by Edwards and Bohlen (1996). There is also a considerable amount of information describing the influence of various environmental and management factors on earthworm populations, but in comparison with insects, for which the population ecology of 92many species has been subjected to quantitative analysis, earthworm population ecology is still largely at a descriptive stage. Population modeling has been used for particular purposes such as risk assessment (Baveco and De Roos 1996), but development of realistic models of field populations has been hindered by a lack of information on key life history parameters and the factors that influence them.","Book : Earthworm ecology","en",2004,"Mar","England","England","10.1201/9781482285246-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781482285246-9","10.1002/ecy.2936","Worldwide","Various","Earthworm Biology;Ecology;Behavior;and Physiology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"The action of an animal ecosystem engineer: Identification of the main mechanisms of earthworm impacts on soil microarthropods. ","Nico Eisenhauer","Nico Eisenhauer","pNon-trophic interactions are shaping soil food web structure and functions. Particularly, the action of ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, are likely to fundamentally impact the abiotic and biotic properties of their environment. The present study aimed to identify the main mechanisms through which earthworms belonging to varying ecological groups – epigeic, endogeic and anecic species – affect soil microarthropods by reviewing the literature on this topic and by performing meta-analyses./ppEarthworm ecological groups differed considerably in their impacts on microarthropods, whereas effects did not vary significantly between microarthropod taxa at the habitat scale. Inconsistent impacts of epigeic species on soil microarthropods are most likely due to differences in earthworm densities. Effects can thus be positive in the case of moderate densities or negative in the case of high densities and associated distinct changes in the physical structure of the upper soil organic layers. By contrast, impacts of endogeic earthworms appeared to be mainly negative and were primarily due to competition with microarthropods for food resources. Consequently, negative impacts on soil microarthropods intensified with increasing earthworm density and biomass. This interaction between endogeic earthworms and microarthropods is better referred to as amensalism due to the competitive predominance of earthworms. Impacts of anecic earthworm species differed significantly from that of endogeic ones; they were neutral at the habitat scale and positive on the microhabitat scale. Moreover, impacts were independent of earthworm densities due to the quasi-territorial behaviour of anecic earthworms. Positive effects were mainly attributed to the formation of stable microhabitats by anecic species; namely burrows/middens, rich in nutrients and microorganisms./ppThe present study points to the relevance of the non-trophic biotic interactions that drive the composition of belowground food webs by identifying the most essential mechanisms underlying the impacts of animal ecosystem engineers on soil microarthropods. Moreover, as earthworms emerge as important biological invaders, the results of the present study may help to fully appreciate, estimate and model the consequences of this momentous global change phenomenon.

"Invasion of a deciduous forest by earthworms: Changes in soil chemistry, microflora, microarthropods and vegetation.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Ecosystems of northern North America existed without earthworm fauna until European settlers arrived and introduced European species. The current extent of invasion by some of these species, emLumbricus terrestris L., emOctolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and emDendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with emL. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where emO. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of emL. terrestris and emO. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when emL. terrestris and emO. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of emO. tyrtaeum (−75% and −22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not.

"Ecosystem responses to exotic earthworm invasion in northern North American forests.","Nico Eisenhauer","Malte Jochum","Earth is experiencing a substantial loss of biodiversity at the global scale, while both species gains and losses are occurring at local and regional scales. The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground–belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research.","European project Ecoworm","en",2016,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.3030/677232","http://dx.doi.org/10.3030/677232","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Northen American forest","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm effects on the incorporation of litter C and N into soil organic matter in a sugar maple forest.","Timothy J. Fahey","Patrick J. Bohlen","To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double‐labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22% ± 5.4% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm‐invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.","Ecology, ecological applications","en",2013,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1890/12-1760.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1760.1","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York state","aggregate;C:N ratio;decomposition;litter;Lumbricus;stoichiometry  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Carbon food resources of earthworms of different ecological groups as indicated by 13C compound-specific stable isotope analysis.","Olga Ferlian","Stefan Scheu","Abstract : One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed δ13C signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA δ13C profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with δ13C signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay–humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2014,"June","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.soilbio.2014602","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.06.002","10.1002/ecy.2936","Germany","Hainich, Thuringia","Clay Endogeic Fatty acids Soil organic matter Soil particle size fractions Stable carbon pools","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have far‐reaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity.Here, we present the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms and soil invertebrates based on 430 observations from 30 independent studies.Our meta‐analysis shows a significant decline of the diversity and density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm invasion with anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms were context‐dependent, such as depending on functional group richness of invasive earthworms and soil depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral soil layers, with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the mixing of soil layers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize microbial communities across soil layers.Our meta‐analysis provides a compelling evidence for negative effects of a common invasive below‐ground ecosystem engineer on below‐ground biodiversity of recipient ecosystems, which could potentially alter the ecosystem functions and services linked to soil biota.","Journal of animal ecology","en",2017,"Aug","Germany","Germany","10.1111/1365-2656.12746","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12746 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","biodiversity change;biological invasion;ecosystem engineer;soil invertebrates;soil micro-organisms  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Linking direct and indirect pathways mediating earthworms, deer, and understory composition in Great Lakes forests.","Nicholas A. Fisichelli","Nico Eisenhauer","Ahistorical drivers such as nonnative invasive earthworms and high deer densities can have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes and plant community composition in temperate and boreal forests of North America. To assess the roles of earthworm disturbance, deer, and environmental factors in the understory, we sampled 125 mixed temperate-boreal forest sites across the western Great Lakes region. We utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to address the hypothesis that earthworm disturbance to the upper soil horizons and selective herbivory by deer are associated with depauperate understory plant communities dominated by graminoid and nonnative species. Evidence of earthworm activity was found at of our sites and had high to very high severity earthworm disturbance. The SEM fit the data well and indicated that widespread nonnative earthworm disturbance and high deer densities had similar magnitudes of impact on understory plant communities and that these impacts were partially mediated by environmental characteristics. One-third of the variation in earthworm disturbance was explained by soil pH, precipitation, and litter quality. Deer density and earthworm disturbance both increased graminoid cover while environmental variables showed direct and indirect relationships. For example, the positive relationship between temperature and graminoids was indirect through a positive temperature effect on deer density. This research characterizes an integrated set of key environmental variables driving earthworm disturbance and deer impacts on the forest understory, facilitating predictions of the locations and severity of future change in northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.","Biological Invasions","en",2012,"Dec","Germany","Germany","10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan","Carex pensylvanica;Climate;Deer browsing;Earthworm invasion;Forest soils;Graminoid cover;Invasive plants;Understory plant community","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm invasion into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests.","Lee E. Frelich","Patrick J. Bohlen","Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can influence primary producers by changing seedbed conditions, soil characteristics, flow of water, nutrients and carbon, and plant–herbivore interactions. The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.","Biological Invasions Belowground: Earthworms as Invasive Species","en",2006,"Jan","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","Temparate and boreal forests ","Aporrectodea;Dendrobaena;Exotic earthworm invasion;Lumbricus rubellus;Lumbricus terrestris;Keystone species;Minnesota forests;New York forests","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms increase plant production: a meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","Scientific Reports","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","USA","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1002/ecy.2936","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Agroecology;Ecosystem services ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Exotic earthworm invasion and microbial biomass in temperate forest soils.","Peter M. Groffman","Timothy J.

We measured the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3–5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the mineral soil. Enrichment of the mineral soil was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots. There was an increase in respiration in the mineral soil at both sites, which is consistent with a movement of organic matter and microbial biomass into the mineral soil. However, N-cycle processes (mineralization and nitrification) did not increase along with respiration. It is likely that the earthworm-induced input of C into the mineral soil created a microbial “sink” for N, preventing an increase in net mineralization and nitrification and conserving N in the soil profile.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0129-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0129-9","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York","nitrogen cycling;nitrogen mineralization;nitrification;respiration","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms increase soil microbial biomass carrying capacity and nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Peter M. Groffman","John C. Maerz","Earthworms have been shown to produce contrasting effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics. We measured soil C and N pools and processes and traced the flow of 13C and 15N from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter into soil microbial biomass and respirable C and mineralizable and inorganic N pools in mature northern hardwood forest plots with variable earthworm communities. Previous studies have shown that plots dominated by either Lumbricus rubellus or Lumbricus terrestris have markedly lower total soil C than uncolonized plots. Here we show that total soil N pools in earthworm colonized plots were reduced much less than C, but significantly so in plots dominated by contain L. rubellus. Pools of microbial biomass C and N were higher in earthworm-colonized (especially those dominated by L. rubellus) plots and more 13C and 15N were recovered in microbial biomass and less was recovered in mineralizable and inorganic N pools in these plots. These plots also had lower rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification than uncolonized reference plots. These results suggest that earthworm stimulation of microbial biomass and activity underlie depletion of soil C and retention and maintenance of soil N pools, at least in northern hardwood forests. Earthworms increase the carrying capacity of soil for microbial biomass and facilitate the flow of N from litter into stable soil organic matter.

Here we show multiple data streams from long-term ecological research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA suggesting that N oligotrophication in forest soils is driven by increased carbon flow from the atmosphere through soils that stimulates microbial immobilization of N and decreases available N for plants. Decreased available N in soils can result in increased N resorption by trees, which reduces litterfall N input to soils, further limiting available N supply and leading to further declines in soil N availability. Moreover, N oligotrophication has been likely exacerbated by changes in climate that increase the length of the growing season and decrease production of available N by mineralization during both winter and spring. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the nature and extent of N cycling in temperate forests and assess how changing conditions will influence forest ecosystem response to multiple, dynamic stresses of global environmental change.","Biogeochemistry","en",2018,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s10533-018-0445-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0445-y","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New Hampshire","Climate change;Carbon;Dissolved organic carbon;Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest;Nitrogen","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of European earthworm invasion on soil characteristics in northern hardwood forests of Minnesota.","Cindy M. Hale","John Pastor","European earthworms are colonizing worm-free hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it’s percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists.

Van Straalen","Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life’s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen‐fixing bacteria are responsible forc.5–20% (grassland and savannah) to 80% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free‐living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest thatc.20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth.

"Exotic earthworm invasions in North America: ecological and policy implications.","PAUL F. HENDRIX","PATRICK J. BOHLEN","Earthworms are the best known and, in many situations, the most important animals that live in soil. Over 3500 earthworm species have been described worldwide, and it is estimated that further surveys will reveal this number to be much larger (Reynolds 1994, Fragoso et al. 1999). Distinct taxonomic groups of earthworms have arisen on every continent except Antarctica, and, through human transport, some groups have been distributed worldwide (Jamieson 1988, Reynolds 1994). The earthworm fauna of North America, including Canada, the continental United States, Mexico, and the islands of the Caribbean, consists of both native (Nearctic and Neotropical) and exotic species imported from many other regions of the world (Fender 1995, Fragoso et al. 1995, James 1995, Reynolds 1995). Any given locality may be inhabited by all native species, all exotic species, a combination of native and exotic species, or by no earthworms at all. Relative abundance and species composition of local fauna depend greatly on soil, climate, vegetation, topography, land use history, and especially on past invasions by exotic species.  Much of our knowledge of the earthworm fauna of North America is based on the work of Gordon E. Gates who, over a 60-year career, collected, described, and cataloged many of the currently recognized taxa, both native and exotic. Beginning in 1949, Gates collaborated with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Bureau of Plant Quarantine (now Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS) to intercept oligochaetes found in “plant-associated materials” (mostly soil) being imported into the United States. Over a 32-year period (1950–1982), Gates (1976, 1982) acquired thousands of specimens and was able to determine that earthworms from all over the world were continually being imported. There is no reason to expect that this situation has changed since 1982. Indeed, as with exotic plants, fungi, and insects (Ruesink et al. 1995, Campbell 2001, Mack and Lonsdale 2001), growing global commerce may be increasing the likelihood that exotic earthworms will be introduced, both inadvertently with the importation of soil-containing materials (e.g., agricultural and horticultural products; Gates 1976, 1982, Boag and Yeates 2001, Ehrenfeld and Scott 2001) and intentionally for use in commercial applications (e.g., waste management and land bioremediation; Lee 1995, Edwards 1998). Because previous invasions by exotic earthworms have had significant impacts on soil processes and plant communities in native ecosystems (e.g., Alban and Berry 1994, Groffman and Bohlen 1999, Hale et al. 2000), there may be reason for concern over continued unrestricted importation of earthworms.  Regulatory activities have not been effective in reducing earthworm introductions in most areas of the world (Boag and Yeates 2001), probably because legal restrictions traditionally have not targeted earthworms or their propagules. There presently are no specific regulations concerning earthworm imports into the United States. Earthworm importations are regulated by APHIS under the Federal Plant Pest Act because of the potential for introduction of exotic plant pathogens in their guts and in soil that might accompany them (Tracy A. Horner, USDA APHIS, personal communication, 3 January 2002). The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe has heightened concern about earthworm imports, because some species may be vectors for that viral pathogen and others (Edwards and Bohlen 1996, Jamieson 2000). APHIS is now considering guidelines specifically for the importation of earthworms into the United States. In this article, which is derived from a report prepared recently for APHIS, we review the status of earthworms in North America, address problems associated with exotic earthworm invasions, and discuss criteria for assessing potential risks of earthworm importation.","BioSciences","en",2002,"Sep","Georgia","USA","10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:eeiina]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052%5B0801:EEIINA%5D2.0.CO;2","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","Various","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm-induced shifts in microbial diversity in soils with rare versus established invasive earthworm populations.","Alexandre B de Menezes","Peter H Thrall","p class=""chapter-para""European earthworms have colonised many parts of Australia, although their impact on soil microbial communities remains largely uncharacterised. An experiment was conducted to contrast the responses to emAporrectodea trapezoides introduction between soils from sites with established (Talmo, 64 emA. trapezoides m−2) and rare (Glenrock, 0.6 emA. trapezoides m−2) emA. trapezoides populations. Our hypothesis was that earthworm introduction would lead to similar changes in bacterial communities in both soils. The effects of earthworm introduction (earthworm activity and cadaver decomposition) did not lead to a convergence of bacterial community composition between the two soils. However, in both soils, the Firmicutes decreased in abundance and a common set of bacteria responded positively to earthworms. The increase in the abundance of emFlavobacterium, Chitinophagaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Sphingobacteriales were consistent with previous studies. Evidence for possible soil resistance to earthworms was observed, with lower earthworm survival in Glenrock microcosms coinciding with emA. trapezoides rarity in this site, lower soil organic matter and clay content and differences in the diversity and abundance of potential earthworm mutualist bacteria. These results suggest that while the impacts of earthworms vary between different soils, the consistent response of some bacteria may aid in predicting the impacts of earthworms on soil ecosystems./p","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","en",2018,"Mar","Australia","Australia","10.1093/femsec/fiy051","https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy051 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Australia","Talmo","16S rRNA sequencing;pasture soils;soil nitrogen;invasive earthworms;soil microbiome;soil ecology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"The influence of invasive earthworms on indigenous fauna in ecosystems previously uninhabited by earthworms.","Sonja Migge-Kleian","Liam Heneghan","Recent studies on earthworm invasion of North American soils report dramatic changes in soil structure, nutrient dynamics and plant communities in ecosystems historically free of earthworms. However, the direct and indirect impacts of earthworm invasions on animals have been largely ignored. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of earthworm invasion on other soil fauna, vertebrates as well as invertebrates.  Earthworm invasions can have positive effects on the abundance of other soil invertebrates, but such effects are often small, transient, and restricted to habitats with harsh climates or a long history of earthworm co-occurrence with other soil invertebrates. Middens and burrows can increase soil heterogeneity and create microhabitats with a larger pore size, high microbial biomass, and microclimates that are attractive to micro- and mesofauna. Under harsh climatic conditions, the aggregates formed by earthworms may increase the stability of soil microclimates. Positive effects can also be seen when comminution and mucus secretion increase the palatability of unpalatable organic material for microorganisms which are the main food of most micro- and mesofaunal groups. For larger invertebrates or small vertebrates, invasive earthworms may become important prey, with the potential to increase resource availability.  In the longer-term, the activity of invading earthworms can have a strong negative impact on indigenous faunal groups across multiple trophic levels. Evidence from field and laboratory studies indicates that the restructuring of soil layers, particularly the loss of organic horizons, physical disturbance to the soil, alteration of understory vegetation, and direct competition for food resources, lead directly and indirectly to significant declines in the abundance of soil micro- and mesofauna. Though studies of invasive earthworm impacts on the abundance of larger invertebrates or vertebrates are generally lacking, recent evidence suggests that reduced abundance of small soil fauna and alteration of soil microclimates may be contributing to declines in vertebrate fauna such as terrestrial salamanders. Preliminary evidence also suggests the potential for earthworm invasions to interact with other factors such as soil pollution, to negatively affect vertebrate populations.","Biological Invasions Belowground: Earthworms as Invasive Species (book)","en",2006,"Jan","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","N/A","Biological invasion;Collembola;Disturbance;Earthworm invasion;Oribatida;Review;Soil fauna;Salamander","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Belowground interactions with aboveground consequences: Invasive earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","Shishir Paudel","Scott R. Loss","A mounting body of research suggests that invasive nonnative earthworms substantially alter microbial communities, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These changes to AMF can cascade to affect plant communities and vertebrate populations. Despite these research advances, relatively little is known about (1) the mechanisms behind earthworms’ effects on AMF and (2) the factors that determine the outcomes of earthworm–AMF interactions (i.e., whether AMF abundance is increased or decreased and subsequent effects on plants). We predict that AMF-mediated effects of nonnative earthworms on ecosystems are nearly universal because (1) AMF are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems, (2) nonnative earthworms have become established in nearly every type of terrestrial ecosystem, and (3) nonnative earthworms, due to their burrowing and feeding behavior, greatly affect AMF with potentially profound concomitant effects on plant communities. We highlight the multiple direct and indirect effects of nonnative earthworms on plants and review what is currently known about the interaction between earthworms and AMF. We also illustrate how the effects of nonnative earthworms on plant–AMF mutualisms can alter the structure and stability of aboveground plant communities, as well as the vertebrate communities relying on these habitats. Integrative studies that assess the interactive effects of earthworms and AMF can provide new insights into the role that belowground ecosystem engineers play in altering aboveground ecological processes. Understanding these processes may improve our ability to predict the structure of plant and animal communities in earthworm-invaded regions and to develop management strategies that limit the numerous undesired impacts of earthworms.","Ecology","en",2015,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1890/15-1085.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1085","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","N/A","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;disturbance;earthworm invasion;ecosystem engineers;plant community;plant–soil interactions  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm activity and soil structure changes due to organic enrichments in vineyard system.","G. Pérès","V. Hallaire"," The effect of organic enrichment on earthworm activity and soil structure was studied in two French vineyards, by comparing control and test plots. In each vineyard the organic matter quantitatively increased the abundance and biomass of the earthworm community. These increases were associated with a higher level of species diversity and a higher evenness corresponding to the development of endogeic community. These earthworm community changes were associated with an increase in granular bioturbated areas and in macroporosity in the top soil layer. The micromorphological approach incorporated an original process of image analysis which appeared to be an appropriate method for characterizing pore morphology in this study. The pores when characterized by their size and shape could be related to ecological groups and growth stages of earthworms.","Biology and fertility of soils","en",1998,"Sep","France","France","10.1007/s003740050452","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003740050452","10.1002/ecy.2936","France ","Champagne, Mâcon, Montbré ","Organic matter  Earthworm activity  Soil structure  Micromorphology  Image analysis","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Performance of the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and between-study heterogeneity.","Jaime L. Peters","Lesley Rushton","The trim and fill method allows estimation of an adjusted meta‐analysis estimate in the presence of publication bias. To date, the performance of the trim and fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in a number of simulated meta‐analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta‐analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta‐analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between‐study heterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is nopublication bias. However, when publication bias is present the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta‐analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the presence of publication bias, when between‐study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various meta‐analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.

"Earthworm species composition affects the soil bacterial community and net nitrogen mineralization.","Maria B. Postma-Blaauw","Lijbert Brussaard","Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the role of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological groups (epigeic: emLumbricus rubellus; endogeic: emAporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: emLumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial community, and on nitrogen mineralization from 15N-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter./ppOur results indicate that emL. rubellus and emL. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas emA. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, emL. rubellus and emA. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil organic matter, whereas emL. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between emL. rubellus and emA. caliginosa, and emL. rubellus and emL. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between emA. caliginosa and emL. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between emA. caliginosa and emL. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity./p","Pedobiologia","en",2006,"Feb","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1016/j.pedobi.2006201","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2006.02.001","10.1002/ecy.2936","The Netherlands","De Bovenbuurt","Soil Earthworms Biodiversity Species interactions Nutrients Functional group","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms and management affect organic matter incorporation and microaggregate formation in agricultural soils.","M.M Pulleman","A.G. Jongmans","Through their feeding activities and cast production, earthworms influence both aggregate turnover and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. We studied the impact of earthworm activity on soil macro- and microaggregation and SOM incorporation in different farming systems. Dry-sieved aggregates (4–12.5 mm) of a permanent pasture (PP), a conventional arable field (CA) and an organic arable field (OA) (0–10 and 10–20 cm depth) were separated into different aggregate fractions, which were analyzed for organic C and N. The separation was based on macromorphological characteristics that reflect the dominant process of aggregate formation and the degree of degradation. We distinguished: two classes of biogenic macroaggregates (fresh casts and welded casts); one class of physicogenic macroaggregates (angular to subangular blocky macroaggregates); and an intermediate fraction (rounded to subrounded macroaggregates). The structural arrangement of mineral particles and organic matter and the quantitative contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) and microaggregates were studied in thin sections. Total organic C contents tended to be higher in biogenic than in physicogenic macroaggregates of the PP and OA soils, whereas the reverse was found for the CA soil. Comparison of the different macroaggregate types in thin sections revealed that the worm-made macroaggregates of the PP soil were considerably enriched in fine POM and microaggregates, in which large amounts of organic matter were intimately mixed with fine mineral material. By contrast, worm casts of the CA and OA soils were hardly enriched in POM and microaggregates. Our study demonstrated that earthworms can directly initiate the formation of microaggregates, which in turn affects the physical protection of SOM against microbial decay. Farming practices that stimulate earthworm activity may thus constitute an important aspect of sustainable agricultural management. However, the much smaller amounts of POM and microaggregates present in worm casts of CA and OA than PP indicate a different impact of earthworms on C stabilization depending on land use. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact management conditions that favour the beneficial effects of earthworms on soil microstructure and associated SOM dynamics. In this respect, the use of micromorphological techniques in addition to chemical and physical analyses was shown to be very valuable.","Applied Soil Ecology","en",2004,"Oct","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.1003","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.10.003","10.1002/ecy.2936","The Netherlands","Zeeland","Farming systems Soil aggregation Soil organic matter Earthworm activity Micromorphology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of non-native Asian earthworm invasion on temperate forest and prairie soils in the Midwestern US.","Jiangxiao Qiu","Monica G. Turner","Effects of invasive European earthworms in North America have been well documented, but less is known about ecological consequences of exotic Asian earthworm invasion, in particular Asian jumping worms (Amynthas) that are increasingly reported. Most earthworm invasion research has focused on forests; some Amynthas spp. are native to Asian grasslands and may thrive in prairies with unknown effects. We conducted an earthworm-addition mesocosm experiment with before–after control-impact (BACI) design and a complementary field study in southern Wisconsin, USA, in 2014 to investigate effects of a newly discovered invasion of two Asian jumping worms (Amynthas agrestis and Amynthas tokioensis) on forest and prairie litter and soil nutrient pools. In both studies, A. agrestis and A. tokioensis substantially reduced surface litter (84–95 % decline in foliage litter mass) and increased total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the upper 0–5 cm of soils over the 4-month period from July through October. Soil inorganic nitrogen (ammonium– and nitrate–N) concentration increased across soil depths of 0–25 cm, with greater effects on nitrate–N. Dissolved organic carbon concentration also increased, e.g., 71–108 % increase in the mesocosm experiment. Effects were observed in both forest and prairie soils, with stronger effects in forests. Effects were most pronounced late in the growing season when earthworm biomass likely peaked. Depletion of the litter layer and rapid mineralization of nutrients by non-native Asian jumping worms may make ecosystems more susceptible to nutrient losses, and effects may cascade to understory herbs and other soil biota.","Biological Invasions","en",2016,"Feb","USA","USA","10.1007/s10530-016-1264-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1264-5","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","southern Wisconsin","Amynthas agrestis;Amynthas tokioensis;Asian jumping worm;Ecosystem change;Nutrient cycling;Wisconsin","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Elemental and mineralogical changes in soils due to bioturbation along an earthworm invasion chronosequence in Northern Minnesota.","Kathryn Resner","Stephen Sebestyen","Minnesota forested soils have evolved without the presence of earthworms since the last glacial retreat. When exotic earthworms arrive, enhanced soil bioturbation often results in dramatic morphological and chemical changes in soils with negative implications for the forests’ sustainability. However, the impacts of earthworm invasion on geochemical processes in soils are not well understood. This study attempts to quantify the role of earthworm invasion in mineral chemical weathering and nutrient dynamics along an earthworm invasion chronosequence in a sugar maple forest in Northern Minnesota. Depth and rates of soil mixing can be tracked with atmospherically derived short lived radioisotopes 210Pb and 137Cs. Their radioactivities increase in the lower A horizon at the expense of the peak activities near the soil surface, which indicate that soil mixing rate and its depth reach have been enhanced by earthworms. Enhanced soil mixing by earthworms is consistent with the ways that the vertical profiles of elemental and mineralogical compositions were affected by earthworm invasion. Biologically cycled Ca and P have peak concentrations near the soil surface prior to earthworm invasion. However, these peak abundances significantly declined in the earthworm invaded soils presumably due to enhanced soil mixing. It is clear that enhanced soil mixing due to earthworms also profoundly altered the vertical distribution of most mineral species within A horizons. Though the mechanisms are not clear yet, earthworm invasion appears to have contributed to net losses of clay mineral species and opal from the A horizons. As much as earthworms vertically relocated minerals and elements, they also intensify the contacts between organic matter and cations as shown in the increased amount of Ca and Fe in organically complexed and in exchangeable pools. With future studies on soil mixing rates and elemental leaching, this study will quantitatively and mechanically address the role of earthworms in geochemical evolution of soils and forests’ nutrient dynamics.","Applied Geochemistry","en",2011,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011347","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011.03.047","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Minnesota","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Thus, mesocosms were constructed to examine changes in microbial biomass and microfaunal communities inside artificial compared with earthworm burrows. Four treatments were established: (i) no worms (CTRL); (ii) unlined, artificial burrows (ARTF); (iii) corn (Zea mays L.) leaf litter‐lined, artificial burrows (LEAF); and (iv) Lumbricus terrestris (L.) burrows (WORM). There were no consistent differences in community structures between unlined, artificial burrows and control soils during a 16‐wk incubation. In contrast, protozoan numbers were elevated throughout the experiment in LEAF and WORM. A succession of nematode abundances occurred in LEAF, with plant parasitic and Tylenchid nematode numbers peaking at 5 wk, followed by high bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode numbers. In WORM, bacterivorous nematode numbers and active bacterial biomass were elevated for 1 and 3 wk, respectively, before declining. Active fungal biomass increased in WORM, whereas fungivorous nematodes were inhibited in earthworm burrows. While litter incorporation appeared to accelerate the rate of trophic interactions in artificial burrows, the effects of earthworms appeared to transcend that of litter translocation into soil, with earthworms differentially selecting for particular food web dynamics.","Soil Science Society America Journal","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.2136/sssaj2004.1160","http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.1160","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Rhode Island, Kingston","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Influence of fragmentation and bioturbation on the decomposition of 14C-labelled beech leaf litter.","Stefan Scheu","Volkmar Wolters","Abstract : One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed δ13C signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA δ13C profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with δ13C signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay–humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",1991,"June ","Germany","Germany","10.1016/0038-0717(91)90039-m","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(91)90039-m","10.1002/ecy.2936","France","Villers, Savigny","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of exotic earthworms on soil phosphorus cycling in two broadleaf temperate forests.","Esteban R. Suarez","Melany C. Fisk","We compared the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) in northern hardwood forest plots invaded by exotic earthworms versus adjacent uninvaded reference plots. In three of the six pairs of plots, earthworm invasion resulted in significantly more total P in the upper 12 cm of soil. The finding of increased amounts of unavailable and occluded inorganic P forms in the invaded plots suggests that earthworm activity mobilized unweathered soil particles from deeper layers of the soil, increasing the stocks of total P in surface soils. In two pairs of plots, the earthworm-invaded soils had less total P than the reference soils. In these plots, earthworm activity resulted in augmented rates of P cycling and alteration of the physical structure of the soil that increased loss of P in leaching water, reducing the total amount of P. We hypothesize that the different effects of earthworm invasion on the soil P cycle result from unique characteristics of the ecological groups of earthworms dominating each site. The invaded plots with increased total P were dominated by the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris, a large earthworm that constructs deep, vertical burrows and is effective at moving soil materials from and to deeper layers of the profile. In contrast, the earthworm-invaded plots where the total P in the surface soil decreased were dominated by the epi-endogeic species L. rubellus, which feeds and lives in the upper organic layers of the soil. In these plots, earthworms significantly increased the amount of readily exchangeable P in the soil, increasing the loss of this element in leaching water.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0128-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0128-x","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Arnot forest, New York","exotic earthworms;invasions;phosphorus cycle;northern hardwood forests","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Invasive earthworm species and nitrogen cycling in remnant forest patches.","Katalin Szlavecz","Ian Yesilonis","Invasive non-native earthworms in forested areas of the northeastern United States are of concern since they have the potential to greatly change the nutrient dynamics of these ecosystems. Urban landscapes are particularly susceptible to non-native species invasions. In this study, we assessed earthworm communities and nitrogen transformations rates in urban and rural forest patches of the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan area, USA. We expected to observe a mixture of native and non-native species at the sites because the region has never been glaciated. The fauna was dominated by European lumbricids. Density and biomass varied between 5 and 288 ind m−2 and 5.2 and 144.0 g m−2, respectively, with urban forests having higher abundances than rural forests. In laboratory incubations, urban forest soils had higher potential N-transformation rates. Both N-mineralization and nitrification rates were positively correlated with soil pH. However, controls on earthworm communities and N-cycling are complex in the Baltimore region, because parent material and soil type also change along the urban–rural gradient. Further studies will separate out land use and inherent soil controls on earthworm populations and N-transformation rates.

"Ecosystem effects of non-native earthworms in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests.","Katalin Szlavecz","Csaba Csuzdi","In many mid-Atlantic forests where both native and non-native earthworms exist, it is the non-native species that are the dominant component of the soil macrofauna. Few earthworm ecology studies, however, focus attention on these forest systems in order to determine the relative ecological roles and potential interactions of the native and non-native earthworms. In a series of field samplings and experimental manipulations we collected data on the effects of earthworms on below-and aboveground ecosystem processes. Earthworm abundance and the ecological processes measured were dynamic in space and time across the range of study sites. Leaf litter decay rates doubled at sites that had abundant non-native earthworms. Earthworms also altered the abundance of soil fungi, the activity of extracellular enzymes, soil respiration, and the growth of tree seedlings but the effects varied among sites depending on differences in land-use history and forest age. Red oak seedling growth was less at sites that had abundant earthworms but tulip poplar and red maple seedlings grew equally well with and without abundant earthworms. These preliminary results suggest that non-native earthworms have significant ecosystem effects, even in forests where native earthworms still occur. Land use history, however, plays an important role in determining what those effects will be, and these effects are likely to be dynamic, depending on the abundance of non-native earthworms.","Biological Invasions","en",2011,"Feb","USA","Hungary","10.1007/s10530-011-9959-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-9959-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","forests at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Maryland","Invasive earthworms;Leaf litter decay;Soil respiration;Microbial activity;Seedling growth","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Terrestrial ecosystem responses to species gains and losses.","David A. Wardle","Wim H. Van der Putten","Ecosystems worldwide are losing some species and gaining others, resulting in an interchange of species that is having profound impacts on how these ecosystems function. However, research on the effects of species gains and losses has developed largely independently of one another. Recent conceptual advances regarding effects of species gain have arisen from studies that have unraveled the mechanistic basis of how invading species with novel traits alter biotic interactions and ecosystem processes. In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes. Species gains and losses are both consequences and drivers of global change; thus, explicit integration of research on how both processes simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning is key to determining the response of the Earth system to current and future human activities.","Science","en",2011,"Oct","Sweden","The Netherlands","10.1126/science.1197479","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197479","10.1002/ecy.2936","Worldwide (Brazil, Chile, New Zaeland, Australia, North America,Scotland)","Southern Chile, Wisonsin.","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

We found most urban and suburban stands had a substantial amount of extractable soil nitrate from July to December 1996, but nitrate pools in the rural stands were negligible. Lab incubations showed that urban and suburban soils nitrified rapidly, but the rural soils did not. Although soil pH was acidic in all stands, nitrification was totally inhibited by acetylene, indicating control of this process by chemoautotrophic rather than by heterotrophic microbes. When we amended soils with NH4+ or P, or raised their pH, nitrification in rural soils was not stimulated, nor was it further elevated in urban soils. Raising pH did, however, increase NH4+ production in all soils. We hypothesize that exotic earthworms, which are present in the urban and suburban stands but not in. the rural stands, may create soil conditions that favor autotrophic nitrifiers.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",1999,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00025-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00025-5","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","oak forest soils along a 130 km urban-re-rural transect in the New York City metropolitan area","Keywords + : HETEROTROPHIC NITRIFICATION;NITROGEN MINERALIZATION;SECONDARY SUCCESSION;PINE FOREST;NITRATE;ECOSYSTEMS;DENITRIFICATION;AVAILABILITY;ENRICHMENT;GRASSLAND","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms affect plant growth and resistance against herbivores: A meta-analysis","Zhenggao Xiao","Sergio Rasmann","Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities. A number of recent studies have explored whether these changes caused by earthworms may in turn affect plant performance and resistance to herbivores, but no formal synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a meta‐analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY ","en",2017,"Nov","China","France","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12969","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various"," detritivore diversity;endogeic earthworms;herbivore-feeding guilds;meta-analysis;plant growth-defence trade-off;plant nutrients;plant resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Chapin","In this chapter, the advances that have been made in understanding the ecology of the mineral nutrition of wild plants from terrestrial ecosystems have been reviewed. This chapter is organized along three lines. First, the issues of nutrient-limited plant growth and nutrient uptake, with special emphasis on the importance of the uptake of nutrients in organic form—both by mycorrhizal and by non-mycorrhizal plants—and the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is treated. In addition, the influence of allocation patterns on mineral nutrient uptake is described. Next, a few of the nutritional aspects of leaf functioning and how nutrients are used for biomass production by the plant are explored. That is done by studying the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) of plants and the various components of NUE. Finally, the feedback of plant species to soil nutrient availability by reviewing patterns in litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization is investigated. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the various aspects of the mineral nutrition of wild plants. The chapter ends with a conceptual description of plant strategies with respect to mineral nutrition (Publisher summary).","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH ","en",2000,"Jan","The Netherlands","France","10.1016/s0065-2504(08)60016-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0065-2504(08)60016-1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Wordlwide (« terrestrial ecosystems »)","Various","Keywords + : NUTRIENT-USE EFFICIENCY;RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE;NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY;SIMULATED ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE;LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION;ABOVE-GROUND PRODUCTIVITY;ALASKAN TUSSOCK TUNDRA;LIFE-SPANERIOPHORUM-VAGINATUM;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Here, I review recent developments in phylogenetic approaches to understanding the evolution of plant defense strategies and plantherbivore coevolutionary interactions. I focus particularly on multivariate defense against insect herbivores, which is the simultaneous deployment of multiple traits, often arranged as convergently evolved defense syndromes. Answering many of the outstanding questions in the biology of plant defense will require generating broad hypotheses that can be explicitly tested by using comparative approaches and interpreting phylogenetic patterns.

"Earthworm functional traits and interspecific interactions affect plant nitrogen acquisition and primary production.","Walter S. Andriuzzi","Thomas Bolger","We performed a greenhouse experiment to test how the functional diversity of earthworms, the dominant group of soil macro-invertebrates in many terrestrial ecosystems, affects nitrogen cycling and plant growth. Three species were chosen to represent a range of functional traits: Lumbricus terrestris (large, mainly detritivorous, makes vertical permanent burrows open at the surface), Aporrectodea longa (medium-large, feeds on both detritus and soil, makes burrows more branched than L. terrestris), and Allolobophora chlorotica (small, geophagous, makes ephemeral burrows below the soil surface). Mesocosms with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were inoculated with none to all three species (similar total biomass), using an experimental design (Simplex) suited to partition single species and diversity effects. Two contrasting N sources, urea or mammalian dung, were labelled with N-15 so that the acquisition by plants and earthworms and recovery of applied N-15 could be estimated.  Over 3 months, plant production was higher with urea applications, but there were also species-specific earthworm effects: A. chlorotica and, to a lesser extent, A. longa increased shoot biomass, whereas L. terrestris increased root biomass. Earthworms did not affect soil N concentrations or leaching losses, whereas more N was leached under urea. A. chlorotica tended to increase dung-N-15 recovery in grass shoots, but in interaction with A. longa had the opposite effect, possibly through increased N immobilization in the microbial biomass. Earthworms assimilated negligible amounts of urea-N-15 but a substantial proportion (17% on average) of the dung-N-15, with no clear-cut differences between species. Our findings show that earthworm species may have similar trophic response to N sources and yet different effects on plant N uptake and primary production, and that inter-specific earthworm interactions can result in non-additive diversity effects.

Further, we determined the effects of soil microbiome‐driven changes in leaf metabolomics on the feeding behavior of Trichopulsia ni larvae.Soil microbiomes differentially impacted plant growth patterns as well as leaf metabolome composition. Similarly, most microbiome‐treated plants showed inhibition to larvae feeding, compared with unamended control plants.

"Experimental evidence that soil fauna enhance nutrient mineralization and plant nutrient uptake in montane grassland ecosystems.","Richard D Bardgett","Kin F Chan","This microcosm study is concerned with understanding those factors which regulate ecosystem processes of nutrient cycling and plant productivity in a montane grassland ecosystem. We examined the effects of different groups of soil fauna, namely bacterial-feeding nematodes and Collembola, on nutrient mineralization (N and P) in an acid, organic soil taken from a montane grassland in the Peak District National Park, United Kingdom. We also examined whether faunal influences on nutrient release, a measure of nutrient mineralization, resulted in changes in nutrient uptake and biomass production of an indigenous montane grass species (Nardus stricta (L.)). We found that in the presence of Collembola, and when nematodes and Collembola were combined, N mineralization, nutrient leaching and shoot N contents of N. stricta was significantly increased relative to a defaunated control. We also found that net P mineralization and leaching increased (although not significantly) in the presence of both nematodes and Collembola, resulting in a significant increase in shoot P content of N. stricta. The presence of nematodes alone, which were largely bacterial-feeders, had no effect on the mineralization of N or P, or shoot nutrient content. We suggest that differences in the effect of faunal treatments on nutrient mineralization are related to the feeding strategies of the added fauna, and to their consequent effect on the size of the soil microbial biomass. The treatments that increased N mineralization and plant nutrient content (N and P) also significantly reduced plant growth (shoot and root). We suggest that high NH4+-N concentrations in the soil solution of Collembola treatments inhibited the growth of N. stricta and that the growth of other grassland species may benefit from this improvement in nutrient availability.

"Earthworm services for cropping systems.","Michel Bertrand","Jean Roger-Estrade","Abstract : Intensive agriculture is often criticized for negative impacts on environment and human health. This issue may be solved by a better management of organisms living in crop fields. Here, we review the benefits of earthworms for crops, and we present techniques to increase earthworm abundance. The major points are the following: (1) Earthworms usually improve soil structural stability and soil porosity and reduce runoff. (2) Earthworms modify soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient cycling. Specifically, earthworms stabilize SOM fractions within their casts, and they also increase the mineralization of organic matter in the short term by altering physical protection within aggregates and enhancing microbial activity. (3) The positive correlation between earthworm abundance and crop production is not systematic, and contrasting effects on yields have been observed. Earthworms induce the production of hormone-like substances that improve plant growth and health. (4) Direct drilling increases earthworm abundance and species diversity, but the beneficial effect of reduced tillage depends upon the species present and tillage intensity. (5) Organic amendments enhance earthworm abundance. (6) Earthworms feeding at soil surface are the most exposed to pesticides and other agrochemicals. Finally, we discuss how to combine management practices, including inoculation, to increase the earthworm services. We conclude that using earthworm services in cropping systems has potential to boost agricultural sustainability.","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ","en",2015,"Apr","France","France","10.1007/s13593-014-0269-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0269-7","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A ","Earthworms;Tillage;Pesticides;Mineralization;Belowground-aboveground interactions;Soil structure;Crop pathogens and parasites;Ecosystem services "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Role of earthworms in soil fertility maintenance through the production of biogenic structures.","Tunira Bhadauria","Krishan Gopal Saxena","Abstract : The soil biota benefits soil productivity and contributes to the sustainable function of all ecosystems. The cycling of nutrients is a critical function that is essential to life on earth. Earthworms (EWs) are a major component of soil fauna communities in most ecosystems and comprise a large proportion of macrofauna biomass. Their activity is beneficial because it can enhance soil nutrient cycling through the rapid incorporation of detritus into mineral soils. In addition to this mixing effect, mucus production associated with water excretion in earthworm guts also enhances the activity of other beneficial soil microorganisms. This is followed by the production of organic matter. So, in the short term, a more significant effect is the concentration of large quantities of nutrients (N, P, K, and Ca) that are easily assimilable by plants in fresh cast depositions. In addition, earthworms seem to accelerate the mineralization as well as the turnover of soil organic matter. Earthworms are known also to increase nitrogen mineralization, through direct and indirect effects on the microbial community. The increased transfer of organic C and N into soil aggregates indicates the potential for earthworms to facilitate soil organic matter stabilization and accumulation in agricultural systems, and that their influence depends greatly on differences in land management practices.

Here we demonstrate that the positive effect of earthworms on rice could be the result of a systemic effect on plant physiology. Moreover, this effect could improve tolerance to stressors such as parasitic nematodes. In a controlled experiment, an 82% decrease in the production of infested plants was suppressed when earthworms were present. Earthworms had no direct effect on nematode population size. In their presence, however, root biomass was not affected by nematodes and the expected inhibition of photosynthesis was suppressed. In the leaves, the expression of three stress‐responsive genes (coding for lipoxygenase, phospholipase D and cysteine protease) was modulated by the presence of belowground invertebrate activities.

Earthworms had a greater stimulating effect on the formation of large macroaggregates (> 2000 mu m) and microaggregates within large macroaggregates when residue was incorporated in the soil, especially in the presence of A. caliginosa. When residue was placed on the surface, residue-derived intra-POM C was highest when L. rubellus was present and significantly lower in the presence of A. caliginosa. Residue-derived inter-POM C was highest when a mix of both species was present. These results indicate that earthworm species differentially affect incorporation of fresh organic matter into stable microaggregates within macroaggregates, and that interactive effects of earthworm species might have important consequences for the incorporation and protection of C inside of microaggregates within macroaggregates especially when residues are placed on the soil surface.

Several studies have actually shown a decrease in nematode populations in the presence of earthworms. We studied interactions between earthworms (the tropical peregrine Pontoscolex corethrurus) and plant-parasitic nematodes (Heterodera sacchari and Pratylenchus zeae) in the laboratory.  In the presence of earthworms, we observed a significant decrease in populations of P. zeae in the rhizosphere of Oryza sativa after 6 weeks (1st generation), and 12 weeks (2nd generation), respectively, in comparison to a control with no earthworms. A parallel experiment with H. sacchari and P. corethrurus showed that H. sacchari cysts were ingested by earthworms with the soil, and the interaction between the gut and the gut contents of P. corethrurus and H. sacchari showed that i) populations of cysts had decreased 5 weeks (1st generation) after the start of the experiment, and ii) the total number of eggs and infesting larvae (J2 alive) had decreased.

"How earthworms affect plant growth: Burrowing into the mechanisms.","George G Brown"," C.A.

However, within particular climatic zones, earthworm assemblages, with fairly characteristic species richness, composition, abundance, and biomass, can often be recognized in broadly different habitat types, such as coniferous forests, deciduous woodland, grassland, and arable land. There is a considerable volume of literature describing the earthworm communities of such habitats, and much of this was summarized by Lee (1985) and updated by Edwards and Bohlen (1996). There is also a considerable amount of information describing the influence of various environmental and management factors on earthworm populations, but in comparison with insects, for which the population ecology of 92many species has been subjected to quantitative analysis, earthworm population ecology is still largely at a descriptive stage. Population modeling has been used for particular purposes such as risk assessment (Baveco and De Roos 1996), but development of realistic models of field populations has been hindered by a lack of information on key life history parameters and the factors that influence them.","Earthworm Ecology","en",2004,"Mar","Brazil","England","10.1201/9781420039719-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781420039719-9","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Worldwide","Various","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Analysis of wheat resistance to the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae using electrical penetration graphs and flow charts combined with correspondence analysis.","Claudia M. Caillaud","J. P. Di Pietro","The behaviour of Sitobion avenae (F.) was compared on resistant wheat lines of Triticum monococcum (L.) and a susceptible variety of Triticum aestivum (L.). Firstly, stylet penetration activities were monitored with the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique and subsequently analysed using flow charts combined with correspondence analysis. Plant resistance was shown to be associated with repeated penetrations without access to either the xylem or the phloem, and with numerous failures in starting a sustained sap ingestion (as represented by pattern E2). Access to sieve elements of the phloem did not seem to be much affected on resistant plants but it took the aphid three times as long to produce a sap ingestion pattern when maintained on the resistant line T. monococcum n ° 44 (Tm44) as compared with aphids maintained on susceptible plants. As a result the total time spent in ingesting from sieve elements was reduced by 72% on Tm44. Secondly, direct observations of freely‐moving apterous adults were performed. Aphids did not discriminate between resistant and susceptible wheat during the first 30 min of access to test leaves, but only 4 out of 25 aphids were still probing after eight hours on resistant Tm44.The relevance of these results to possible location of the resistance factor(s) are discussed. Although detection of plant resistance before sieve elements are reached can not be rigorously excluded, the factors involved in T. monococcum resistance to S. avenae undoubtedly occur within the phloem vessels.","ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA ","en",1995,"Apr","USA","France","10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01904.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01904.x","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","Homoptera sitobion avenae;triticum monococcum;resistance mechanisms;probing behaviour;electronic monitoring;flow charts;correspondence analysis"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The green peach aphid Myzus persicae perform better on pre-infested Chinese cabbage Brassica pekinensis by enhancing host plant nutritional quality","He-He Cao","Tong-Xian Liu","The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer, is a notorious pest on vegetables, which often aggregates in high densities on crop leaves. In this study, we investigated whether M. persicae could suppress the resistance level of Chinese cabbage Brassica pekinensis. M. persicae performed better in terms of weight gain (~33% increase) and population growth (~110% increase) when feeding on previously infested (pre-infested) Chinese cabbage compared with those on non-infested plants. However, when given a choice, 64% of the aphids preferred to settle on non-infested leaves, while 29% of aphids chose pre-infested leaves that had a 2.9 times higher concentration of glucosinolates. Aphid feeding significantly enhanced the amino acid:sugar ratio of phloem sap and the absolute amino acid concentration in plant leaves. Aphid infestation significantly increased the expression levels of salicylic acid (SA) marker genes, while it had marginal effects on the expression of jasmonate marker genes. Exogenously applied SA or methyl jasmonate had no significant effects on M. persicae performance, although these chemicals increased glucosinolates concentration in plant leaves.

Through the bioturbating action of earthworms, soil is biologically, chemically, and physically altered; nutrients are translocated; organic matter is decomposed and transformed; and the surrounding biota interacts as a large orchestra where the soil musicians play together on the various instruments but where earthworms take a leading role, enhancing microbial activity and generally stimulating plant growth.

"Earthworms as drivers of the competition between grasses and legumes.","Nico Eisenhauer","S. Scheu","Grasses and legumes are grown together worldwide to improve total herbage yield and the quality of forage, however, the causes of population oscillations of grasses and legumes are poorly understood. Especially in grasslands, earthworms are among the most important detritivore animals functioning as ecosystem engineers, playing a key role in nutrient cycling and affecting plant nutrition and growth. The objectives of the present greenhouse experiment were to quantify the effects of earthworms on grass–legume competition in model grassland systems at two harvesting dates – simulating the widespread biannual mowing regime in Central European grasslands.  The presence of earthworms increased the productivity of grasses and legumes after 6 weeks but only that of grasses after another 10 weeks. In mixed treatments, the presence of grasses and earthworms decreased legume shoot biomass, the amount of nitrogen (N) in shoot tissue and the number of legume flowerheads while the presence of legumes and earthworms increased the amount of N in grass shoots and the infestation of grasses with aphids. Analyses of 15N/14N ratios indicate that, compared to legumes, grasses more efficiently exploit soil mineral N and benefit from legume presence through reduced “intra-functional group” competition. In contrast to previous experiments, we found no evidence for N transfer from legumes to grasses. However, legume presence improved total herbage and N yield.  Earthworms likely modulate the competition between grasses and legumes by increasing soil N uptake by plants and thereby increasing the competitive strength of grasses. Earthworms function as essential driving agents of grass–legume associations by (I) increasing grass yield, (II) increasing the amount of N in grass hay, (III) increasing the infestation rate of grasses with aphids, and (IV) potentially reducing the attractiveness of grass–legume associations to pollinators.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2008,"Jul","USA","USA","10.3410/f.1123874.580974","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.1123874.580974","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Jena, Thuringia","Above-ground–below-ground interactions Aphid infestation Competition Flowering success Grassland Lumbricus terrestris Nitrogen uptake Quality of forage Stable isotopes The Jena Experiment"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

However, aphid salivary proteins also are recognized by plants to mount defense responses and are likely a major factor in limiting the host range of particular aphid species and biotypes.

"The growth-defense trade-off and habitat specialization by plants in Amazonian forests.","Paul V. A. Fine","Phyllis D. Coley","Tropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has led to specialization in plants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-rich clay forests surround nutrient-poor white-sand forests, each harboring a unique composition of habitat specialist trees. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong natural selection for plant defenses in white-sand forest, while rapid growth is favored in clay forests. Recently, we reported evidence from a reciprocal-transplant experiment that manipulated the presence of herbivores and involved 20 species from six genera including phylogenetically independent pairs of closely related white-sand and clay specialists. When protected from herbivores, clay specialists exhibited faster growth rates than white-sand specialists in both habitats. But, when unprotected, white-sand specialists outperformed clay specialists in white-sand habitat, and clay specialists outperformed white-sand specialists in clay habitat.  Here we test further the hypothesis that the growth-defense trade-off contributes to habitat specialization by comparing patterns of growth, herbivory, and defensive traits in these same six genera of white-sand and clay specialists. While the probability of herbivore attack did not differ between the two habitats, an artificial defoliation experiment showed that the impact of herbivory on plant mortality was significantly greater in white-sand forests. We quantified the amount of terpenes, phenolics, leaf toughness, and available foliar protein for the plants in the experiment. Different genera invested in different defensive strategies, and we found strong evidence for phylogenetic constraint in defense type. Overall, however, we found significantly higher total defense investment for white-sand specialists, relative to their clay specialist congeners. Furthermore, herbivore resistance consistently exhibited a significant trade-off against growth rate in each of the six phylogenetically independent species-pairs.  These results confirm theoretical predictions that a trade-off exists between growth rate and defense investment, causing white-sand and clay specialists to evolve divergent strategies. We propose that the growth-defense trade-off is universal and provides an important mechanism by which herbivores govern plant distribution patterns across resource gradients.","ECOLOGY ","en",2006,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[150:tgtahs]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87%5B150:tgtahs%5D2.0.co;2","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Peru","Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve near Iquitos","Amazon;ecological gradient;growth-defense trade-off;habitat specialization;herbivory;phenolics;phylogenetic control;rainforest;reciprocal-transplant experiment;terpenes;tropical trees "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The dilemma of plants: To grow or defend.","Daniel A. Herms","Wu Mattson","Physiological and ecological constraints play key roles in the evolution of plant growth patterns, especially in relation to defenses against herbivores. Phenotypic and life history theories are unified within the growth-differentiation balance (GDB) framework, forming an integrated system Of theories explaining and predicting patterns of plant defense and competitive interactions in ecological and evolutionary time.  Plant activity at the cellular level can be classified as growth (cell division and enlargement) of differentiation (chemical and morphological changes leading to cell maturation and specialization). The GDB hypothesis of plant defense is premised upon a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes. The trade-off between growth and defense exists because secondary metabolism and structural reinforcement are physiologically constrained in dividing and enlarging cells, and because they divert resources from the production of new leaf area. Hence the dilemma of plants: They must grow fast enough to compete, yet maintain the defenses necessary to survive in the presence of pathogens and herbivores.  The physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes interacts with herbivory and plant-plant competition to manifest itself as a genetic trade-off between growth and defense in the evolution of plant life history strategies. Evolutionary theories of plant defense are reviewed. We also extend a standard growth rate model by separating its ecological and evolutionary components, and formalizing the role of competition in the evolution of plant defense. We conclude with a conceptual model of the evolution of plant defense in which plant physiological trade-offs interact with the abiotic environment, competition and herbivory.","QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ","en",1992,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1086/417659","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/417659","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A ","Keyword + : CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE;CYNOGLOSSUM-OFFICINALE;LOTUS-CORNICULATUS;LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION;LOW NUTRITIVE QUALITY;SENECIO-JACOBAEA;INSECT HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS;TISSUE-SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTION;SHRUB OEMLERIA-CERASIFORMIS;PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms influence the production of above and belowground biomass and the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ulrike Jana","Anne Repellin","To better understand the complex mechanisms of action of earthworms on plants, we set up an experimental system using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh, Aporrectodea caliginosa a common temperate earthworm and two types of soil with contrasted contents in organic matter and nutrients. Changes in plant biomass, biomass allocation to roots, leaves and stems and C/N ratios were related to variations in the expression of several plant genes involved in cellular division and stress responses and with earthworm-induced alterations in soil mineral status.  In the poorest soil, i.e. with low contents in mineral nutrient and organic matter, earthworms increased soil nitrate content very significantly and boosted plant aboveground biomass production. This correlated with changes in leaf transcript accumulation suggesting enhanced cell division and lesser incidence of reactive oxygen species. In the richer soil, earthworms had no significant effect on the production of aerial biomass. However, several plant responses were observed regardless of soil quality: enhanced accumulation of an auxin-responsive transcript in the leaves, a strong decrease in root length and biomass and a reduction in C/N values, particularly in the bolt stems. Although these results pointed out earthworm-induced enhancement of mineralization as a determining factor in the formidable plant growth responses, the release in the drilosphere of phytohormone-like compounds by earthworm-activated bacteria was most likely implicated as well in this process and resulted in ""forced"" nitrogen uptake by the plants.

"Evolutionary ecology of plant defences against herbivores.","Marc T. J. Johnson","Marc T. J. Johnson"," 1. Herbivores consume a large portion of the biomass produced by plants in virtually all ecosystems, which has dramatic effects on both the ecology and evolution of plants. In response to this threat, plants have evolved a diverse arsenal of direct and indirect defences to reduce herbivory and the impacts of damage on plant performance. 2. This special feature is a broad synthesis of the evolution and ecology of plant defences. The first objective of this special feature is to provide a review of what we have learned about plant defences against herbivores. The second objective is to stimulate debate and sow fresh ideas for the future research. 3. The 11 articles in this issue address three fundamental questions: (i) How do plants defend themselves against a diverse array of enemies? (ii) Why do plant species vary in defence? And (iii) What are the ecological and ecosystem‐level consequences of plant defence? In addressing these questions the articles cover the interdisciplinary nature of plant–herbivore evolutionary ecology, from genes to global patterns. 4. The articles contained in the special feature question existing paradigms and provide new analyses of data. In some cases, influential hypotheses are firmly supported with new analyses (e.g. the Resource Availability Hypothesis), whereas in other instances conventional wisdom is called into question (e.g. the importance of secondary metabolites in the microevolution of resistance) and popular hypotheses are rejected (e.g. the Apparency Hypothesis, the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis). 5. This is an exciting time for research on the evolutionary ecology of plant defences.

"Plant mediated effects of soil invertebrates and summer drought on above-ground multitrophic interactions.","Scott N. Johnson","Susan E. Hartley"," 1. We conducted a large‐scale field study to determine how the interactive effects of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and summer drought affected plant communities containing barley (Hordeum vulgare), shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa‐pastoris) and common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris), and how such effects then influenced populations of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and its parasitoid, Aphidius ervi. 2. Total biomass of plant communities decreased by around 25% with summer drought, but was increased by the presence of earthworms by over 11%. The effects of drought and earthworms on H. vulgare differed in monocultures and mixed plant communities. In monocultures, earthworms had the biggest impact, increasing plant biomass, but drought had the biggest effect in multi‐species communities, causing a decrease in biomass. 3. Drought had an extremely negative impact on S. vulgaris shoot and root biomass, but this was ameliorated in the roots when earthworms were present. Capsella bursa‐pastoris was not significantly affected by drought or earthworms. Drought caused a significant increase in shoot nitrogen concentrations in all plants, including H. vulgare (from 19.2 to 23.8 mg g−1). 4. In total, 35 234 aphids were recorded, of which 3936 were parasitized. Drought conditions reduced aphid abundance by over 50%. The interaction was moderated by earthworms, which caused further declines in R. padi populations under drought conditions, most notably in monocultures. 5. The plant‐mediated effects of drought and earthworms (negative and positive, respectively) on R. padi had cascading effects on the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, which declined in abundance with reduced numbers of R. padi. In addition, drought had a negative impact on A. ervi abundance beyond its impacts on aphid density, suggesting reduced prey quality as well as quantity. 6.;;Synthesis. This study demonstrated the effect of predicted climate change (i.e. reduced summer rainfall) on plant‐mediated interactions between earthworms and above‐ground multitrophic groups. These effects were seen to differ between monocultures and multi‐species plant communities, suggesting that changes in above‐ground–below‐ground linkages in response to drought may influence plant communities in the future.","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY ","en",2011,"Jan","Australia","England","10.1111/j.1365-2745.20101748.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01748.x","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","UK","Scottish Crop Research Institute","above-ground–below-ground;aphids;Capsella bursa-pastoris;climate change;decomposers;Hordeum vulgare;parasitoids;plant–herbivore interactions;Senecio vulgaris  "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Plant mediated effects of earthworms on aphid dynamics.","K. Nawzad","Nawzad Kadir","The individual and combined effects of the endogeic and epigeic groups of earthworms on the growth of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa), and on the subsequent growth and development of the generalist sap-sucking herbivore Myzus persicae were determined in separate pot experiments. Many previous studies have investigated the relationship between soil biodiversity and aboveground plants, but few researches have considered the indirect interaction between soil biota and above-ground aphids. In this study the individual effects of Aporrectodea rosea and Allolobophora chlorotica and the combined effects of A. rosea and A. chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis, and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, Lumbricus rubellus and S. mammalis on plant morphology and physiology and aphid development (nymphs day-1, fecundity and number of adults) were investigated. Plant growth was affected by the presence of A. rosea which caused increases in plant biomass, height of plant, leaf surface area and specific leaf area (SLA). Mean number of leaves per plant was unaffected by worm density. In contrast, increasing density of A. chlorotica had no effect on any aspect of plant performance. The combined effect of A. rosea and A. chlorotica resulted in a similar increase in plant biomass to A. rosea alone. While the combined effects of A. caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis caused increases in all plant parameters except leaf number. Additionally, the individual effect of A. rosea and the combined effects of A. caliginosa and S. mammalis, A. chlorotica & S. mammalis and A. rosea and A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis resulted in increased in leaf nitrogen concentration. Aphid development was also affected by the presence of earthworms. The nymphs day-1, fecundity and numbers of adults were significantly increased with increases in earthworm densities. The interaction between all groups of earthworms and their influence on aphid growth showed that the combined effect of two different groups was greater than the individual groups. Proteomic techniques were used to compare protein patterns in the plants. The combined effects of A. caliginosa and S. mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis, A. rosea, A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis earthworms on plant resulted in differences in number and kind of protein between plant treated with earthworms and the control, but no significant difference in proteins volume.

"Induced responses to herbivory. ","Richard Karban","Ian T. Baldwin","Plants face a daunting array of creatures that eat them, bore into them, and otherwise use virtually every plant part for food, shelter, or both. But although plants cannot flee from their attackers, they are far from defenseless. In addition to adaptations like thorns, which may be produced in response to attack, plants actively alter their chemistry and physiology in response to damage. For instance, young potato plant leaves being eaten by potato beetles respond by producing chemicals that inhibit beetle digestive enzymes.  Over the past fifteen years, research on these induced responses to herbivory has flourished, and here Richard Karban and Ian T. Baldwin present the first comprehensive evaluation and synthesis of this rapidly developing field. They provide state-of-the-discipline reviews and highlight areas where new research will be most productive.

"Herbivore diet breadth and host plant defense mediate the tri-trophic effects of plant toxins on multiple coccinellid predators.","Angelos Katsanis","Kailen A. Mooney","Host plant defenses are known to cascade up food chains to influence herbivores and their natural enemies, but how herbivore and predator traits and identity mediate such tri-trophic dynamics is largely unknown. We assessed the influence of plant defense on aphid and coccinellid performance in laboratory trials with low-vs. high-glucosinolate varieties of Brassica napus, a dietary specialist (Brevicoryne brassicae) and generalist (Myzus persicae) aphid, and five species of aphidophagous coccinellids. The performance of the specialist and generalist aphids was similar and unaffected by variation in plant defense. Aphid glucosinolate concentration and resistance to predators differed by aphid species and host plant defense, and these effects acted independently. With respect to aphid species, the dietary generalist aphid (vs. specialist) had 14% lower glucosinolate concentration and coccinellid predators ate three-fold more aphids. With respect to host plant variety, the high-glucosinolate plants (vs. low) increased aphid glucosinolate concentration by 21%, but had relatively weak effects on predation by coccinellids and these effects varied among coccinellid species. In turn, coccinellid performance was influenced by the interactive effects of plant defense and aphid species, as the cascading, indirect effect of plant defense was greater when feeding upon the specialist than generalist aphid. When feeding upon specialist aphids, low-(vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by 78% and accelerated development by 14%. In contrast, when feeding upon generalist aphids, low-(vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by only 11% and had no detectable effect on development time. These interactive effects of plant defense and aphid diet breadth on predator performance also varied among coccinellid species; the indirect negative effects of plant defenses on predator performance was consistent among the five predators when transmitted via the dietary specialist aphid, but these effects varied substantially among predators-in both the magnitude and directionwhen transmitted via the dietary generalist aphid. Accordingly, the cascading effect of plant defense on predators was stronger in magnitude and more consistent among predator taxa when transmitted by the specialist than generalist herbivore. Overall, these findings support a central role of herbivore diet breadth in mediating both the strength and contingency of tri-trophic interactions.","PLOS ONE ","en",2016,"May","USA","USA","10.1371/journal.pone155716","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155716","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","Keywords+: INSECT HERBIVORES;BREVICORYNE-BRASSICAE;IRIDOID GLYCOSIDES;MYZUS-PERSICAE;HIGH-MORTALITY;SLOW-GROWTH;BEHAVIOR;SPECIFICITY;EVOLUTION;ECOLOGY"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms, collembola and residue management change wheat (Triticum aestivum) and herbivore pest performance (Aphidina: Rhophalosiphum padi).","Xin Ke","Stefan Scheu","Management practices of arable systems determine the distribution of soil organic matter thereby changing decomposer animal activity and their impact on nutrient mineralization, plant growth and plant–herbivore interactions. Decomposer-mediated changes in plant growth and insect pest performance were investigated in wheat–aphid model systems in the greenhouse. Three types of litter distribution were established: litter patch at the soil surface (simulating mulching), litter patch deeper in soil (simulating ploughing) and litter homogeneously mixed into soil (simulating disk cultivation). The litter was labelled with 15N to follow the mineralization and uptake of nutrients by the plants. Earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and Collembola (Protaphorura armata) were included as representatives of major functional groups of decomposers. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was planted and aphids (Rhophalosiphum padi) were introduced to leaves as one of the most important pests. Earthworms, Collembola and litter distribution affected plant growth, N acquisition and aphid development in an interactive way. Earthworms and Collembola increased biomass of seeds, shoots and roots of wheat. Increased plant growth by earthworms and Collembola was mainly due to increased transfer of N from soil (rather than litter) into plants. Despite increasing plant growth, earthworms reduced aphid reproduction. Aphid reproduction was not correlated closely with plant N concentrations, but rather with the concentration of litter N in wheat. Unexpectedly, both Collembola and earthworms predominantly affected the mobilization of N from soil organic matter, and by altering the distribution of litter earthworms reduced infestation of crops by aphids via reducing plant capture of litter N, in particular if the litter was concentrated deeper in soil. The results suggest that management practices stimulating a continuous moderate increase in nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter rather than nutrient flushes from decomposing fresh organic matter result in maximum plant growth with minimum plant pest infestation.","Oecologia","en",2008,"Jul","China","Germany","10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Darmstadt","Arable system;Heterogeneous rhizosphere;Detritivore;Litter decomposition;Nitrogen-15"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeding on Arabidopsis induces the formation of a deterrent indole glucosinolate.","Jae Hak Kim","Georg Jander","Cruciferous plants produce a wide variety of glucosinolates as a protection against herbivores and pathogens. However, very little is known about the importance of individual glucosinolates in plant defense and the regulation of their production in response to herbivory. When Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeds on Arabidopsis aliphatic glucosinolates pass through the aphid gut intact, but indole glucosinolates are mostly degraded. Although aphid feeding causes an overall decrease in Arabidopsis glucosinolate content, the production of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is induced. This altered glucosinolate profile is not a systemic plant response, but is limited to the area in which aphids are feeding. Aphid feeding on detached leaves causes a similar change in the glucosinolate profile, demonstrating that glucosinolate transport is not required for the observed changes. Salicylate‐mediated signaling has been implicated in other plant responses to aphid feeding. However, analysis of eds5, pad4, npr1 and NahG transgenic Arabidopsis, which are compromised in this pathway, demonstrated that aphid‐induced changes in the indole glucosinolate profile were unaffected. The addition of purified indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate to the petioles of cyp79B2 cyp79B3 mutant leaves, which do not produce indole glucosinolates, showed that this glucosinolate serves as a precursor for the aphid‐induced synthesis of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. In artificial diets, 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is a significantly greater aphid deterrent in the absence of myrosinase than its metabolic precursor indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. Together, these results demonstrate that, in response to aphid feeding, Arabidopsis plants convert one indole glucosinolate to another that provides a greater defensive benefit.","PLANT JOURNAL ","en",2007,"Mar","South Korea ","USA","10.1111/j.1365-313x.20063019.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313x.2006.03019.x ","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","USA","USDA Plant Soil and Nutrition Laboratory, Ithaca, NY","Arabidopsis;indole glucosinolate;Myzus persicae;aphid;defense "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Meta-analysis of sources of variation in fitness costs of plant antiherbivore defenses.","Julia Koricheva","Julia Koricheva","Plant defense theories predict that allocation to antiherbivore defenses should impose a cost on plants, manifested as a reduction in growth and reproduction. However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r = -0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r = -0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast. the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores. type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced). concentrations of defensive compounds. or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.","ECOLOGY ","en",2002,"Jan","England ","England","10.2307/2680130","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2680130","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","allocation costs;antiherbivore defense;ecological costs;meta-analysis;opportunity cost;strade-off "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of mycorrhizal fungi on insect herbivores: A meta-analysis.","Julia Koricheva","Tara Jones","Mycorrhizal status of the host plant is often ignored in studies on plant–herbivore interactions, but mycorrhizal colonization is known to induce many morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in host plants, which in turn may alter plant quality as a host for insect herbivores. Both positive and negative effects of mycorrhizal colonization of the host plant on performance and density of insect herbivores have been reported in previous studies. We have conducted a meta‐analysis of 34 published and unpublished studies on this topic in order to find out the sources of variation in mycorrhizae effects on insect herbivores. Effects of mycorrhizae on chewing insects depended upon the parameter measured and the degree of herbivore feeding specialization. Density and consumption of chewing insects were higher on mycorrhizal plants, but this did not lead to greater plant damage, presumably because herbivore survival tended to be lower on mycorrhizal plants. Mono‐ and oligophagous chewers benefited from mycorrhizal colonization of their host plants, whereas performance of polyphagous chewers was reduced on mycorrhizal plants. Among sucking insects, phloem feeders benefited from mycorrhizal infection, but performance of mesophyll feeders was lower on mycorrhizal plants. The type of mycorrhiza was not important for chewing insects, but performance of sucking insects was increased more by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) than by ectomycorrhizae (ECM). Among AM inoculation studies, the most commonly used fungal species,Glomus intraradices, tended to have a negative effect on chewer performance, whereas all other fungal species tended to have a positive effect. There was no significant difference in results between studies using inoculation and fungicides, field and laboratory studies, and published and unpublished studies. Mycorrhizal status of the host plant thus influences insect herbivore performance, but the magnitude and direction of the effect depend upon the feeding mode and diet breadth of the insect and the identity of fungi.","ECOLOGY ","en",2009,"Aug","England","England","10.1890/08-1555.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1555.1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","arbuscular mycorrhizae;ectomycorrhizae;feeding guilds;insect herbivores;meta-analysis;multitrophic interactions "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Effects of residue decomposition on productivity and soil fertility in rice–wheat rotation.","Yadvinder-Singh","C. S. Bueno","Rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) farmers in India burn or remove residues to facilitate seedbed preparation. Incorporation of residues before planting of the next crop generally decreases yields due to N immobilization. Since a window of about 40 d is available between rice harvest and wheat planting, the effect of time of incorporation on rice residue decomposition and N mineralization–immobilization was studied in 1992–1993. The mass loss of residue was 25% for a 10‐d, 35% for a 20‐d, and 51% for a 40‐d decomposition period before wheat planting. Nitrogen release from residue ranged from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 during the wheat season. The immobilization of urea N decreased when residue was allowed to decompose for 10‐d or longer. Based on these studies, a long‐term (1993–2000) experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil to examine the effect of time of residue incorporation before sowing wheat when compared with burning or removal of residue on yields, N‐use efficiency, and soil fertility. The effect of wheat residue incorporation with green manure (GM, Sesbania cannabina L.) on subsequent rice yields was also determined. Residue incorporation for 10 to 40 d had no effect on wheat yields. Rice yields increased (0.18–0.39 Mg ha−1) when wheat residue was incorporated with GM. Starter N applied at residue incorporation did not influence wheat yields but decreased N recovery efficiency. Physiological efficiency was higher when rice straw was incorporated in wheat and when wheat straw plus GM were incorporated in rice than when rice straw was incorporated for 10 d or when the straw was burned. The long‐term application of rice residue increased C accumulation in soil.","SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL ","en",2004,"May","India","Philippines","10.2136/sssaj2004.8540","http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.8540","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","India ","research farm of the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana","Keywords +: BARLEY STRAW DECOMPOSITION;CROP RESIDUE;NITROGEN DYNAMICS;MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES;IMMOBILIZATION;QUALITY;TILLAGE;CARBON;YIELDS;CORN"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of an endogeic and an anecic earthworm on the competition between four annual plants and their relative fecundity.","Kam-Rigne Laossi","Sébastien Barot","Competition between plants for essential resources determines the distribution of biomasses between species as well as the composition of plant communities through effects on species reproductive potentials. Soil organisms influence plant competitive ability and access to resources: thus they should modify plant community composition. The effects of an endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and an anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) earthworm species on the competition between grass (Poa annual, two forbs (Veronica persica and Cerastium glomeratum) and legume (Trifolium dubium) were investigated in a greenhouse experiment. We established two types of plant communities: monocultures and polycultures of the four species. L terrestris increased the biomass of P. annua and V. persica (in monocultures as well as in polycultures). However, the presence of L terrestris allowed the grass to produce the highest biomass in polycultures suggesting that this earthworm species promoted the growth of P. annua against the other plant species. In monocultures as well as in polycultures, the presence of L terrestris to increased the number of seeds of T dubium and the total seed mass of V. persica. These results suggest that L terrestris enhanced the short term competitive ability of P. annua by promoting its growth. The increased number of seeds of T dubium in the presence of L terrestris suggests that this earthworm species could enhance the long-term competitive ability of this legume and may increase its number of individuals after several generations.

"Life-history constraints in grassland plant species: A growth-defence trade-off is the norm.","Eric M. Lind","Peter D. Wragg","Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting trade‐off possibilities. The competition‐defence hypothesis posits a trade‐off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth‐defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth‐defence trade‐off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life‐history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth‐defence trade‐off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.","ECOLOGY LETTERS ","en",2013,"Apr","USA","USA","10.1111/ele.12078","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12078","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","CH = Switzerland; CN = China; DE = Germany; TZ = Tanzania; ZA = South Africa.

"Decomposers and root feeders interactively affect plant defence in Sinapis alba.","Maité Lohmann","Caroline Müller","Aboveground herbivory is well known to change plant growth and defence. In contrast, effects of soil organisms, acting alone or in concert, on allocation patterns are less well understood. We investigated separate and combined effects of the endogeic earthworm species Aporrectodea caliginosa and the root feeding nematode species Pratylenchus penetrans and Meloidogyne incognita on plant responses including growth and defence metabolite concentrations in leaves of white mustard, Sinapis alba. Soil biota had a strong impact on plant traits, with the intensity varying due to species combinations. Nematode infestation reduced shoot biomass and nitrogen concentration but only in the absence of earthworms. Earthworms likely counteracted the negative effects of nematodes. Infestation with the migratory lesion-nematode P. penetrans combined with earthworms led to increased root length. Earthworm biomass increased in the presence of this species, indicating that these nematodes increased the food resources of earthworms-presumably dead and decaying roots. Nitrogen-based defence compounds, i.e. glucosinolates, did not correlate with nitrogen levels. In the presence of earthworms, concentrations of aromatic glucosinolates in leaves were significantly increased. In contrast, infection with P. penetrans strongly decreased concentrations of glucosinolates (up to 81%). Infestation with the sedentary nematode M. incognita induced aromatic glucosinolates by more than 50% but only when earthworms were also present. Myrosinase activities, glucosinolate-hydrolysing enzymes, were unaffected by nematodes but reduced in the presence of earthworms. Our results document that root-feeding nematodes elicit systemic plant responses in defence metabolites, with the responses varying drastically with nematode species of different functional groups. Furthermore, systemic plant responses are also altered by decomposer animals, such as earthworms, challenging the assumption that induction of plant responses including defence traits is restricted to herbivores. Soil animals even interact and modulate the individual effects on plant growth and plant defence, thereby likely also influencing shoot herbivore attack.","OECOLOGIA ","en",2009,"Mar","Germany","Germany","10.1007/s00442-009-1306-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1306-0","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Kiepenkerl, Norken,","Multitrophic interactions;Brassicaceae;Glucosinolate;Myrosinase;Induction "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"How earthworm activities affect banana plant response to nematodes parasitism.","G. Loranger-Merciris","H. Ozier-Lafontaine","The burrowing nematode Radopholus similis and the lesion nematodes Pratylenchus spp. are considered as major constraints to banana cultivation worldwide. As an alternative to the use of chemical pesticides in commercial banana plantations, the possible role of the earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus was studied regarding the reducing harmfulness of the main plant-feeding nematodes of banana. The interactions among banana plants, plant-feeding nematodes and earthworms have been tested in a controlled experiment combining treatments including or not earthworms and nematodes, over a complete vegetative banana development cycle. The aim of the work was to evaluate how earthworm activity can affect the pathogenicity of the three main plant-feeding nematodes associated with dessert banana (Musa spp. AAA group, cv. Cavendish) in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), R. similis, Pratylenchus coffeae and Helicotylenchus multicinctus.  Results showed that damages caused by plant-feeding nematodes were lowered in the presence of the earthworm P. corethrurus; the population of plant-feeding nematodes did not decrease whereas root damage induced by nematodes was significantly reduced (50% reduction of root necrosis in the presence of earthworms). Moreover, in the presence of P. corethrurus, we observed a change of soil porosity. On the one hand, the burrowing activity of earthworms destroyed most of the initial structural porosity (mesobiotic pores, 3-300 mu m) and on the other hand, they increased the volume of the finest structural pores diameter class (microbiotic pores, 0.3-3 mu m). P. corethrurus also stimulated phosphorus mineralization.  Soil bioturbation carried out by P. corethrurus could have enhanced the efficiency of microbial community that is involved in phosphorus bioavailability. This observation was corroborated by a higher phosphorus availability in earthworm casts (1386 +/- 38 mg 13 kg(-1) of dry matter in cast versus 778 +/- 61 mg P kg(-1) of dry matter in the soil compartment not influenced by earthworm activity), and a better plant phosphorus nutrition in the presence of earthworms. Phosphorus uptake resulted in a better plant nutrition and a better tolerance to plant-feeding nematodes. Besides, the reduction of the mesobiotic porosity by bioturbation could also have disturbed the nematodes activities during their soil phase and contributed to the reduction of their damage.","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY ","en",2012,"Jan","France","France ","10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.1003","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.003","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Guadeloupe, French West Indies","greenhouse at the INRA research station of Duclos, Petit-Bourg","Phosphorus uptake;Pontoscolex corethrurus;Radopholus similis;Pratylenchus coffeae;Helicotylenchus multicinctus;Pore size distribution "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The continuum of plant responses to herbivory: The influence of plant association, nutrient availability, and timing.","Joyce Maschinski","Thomas G. Whitham","In a single population of Ipomopsis arizonica (Polemoniaceae), we show a continuum of compensatory responses to vertebrate herbivory. We demonstrate experimentally that the degree of herbivore impact depends on plant association, nutrient availability, and timing of grazing. From 1985 to 1987, the most common response to vertebrate herbivory was equal compensation, whereby grazed plants set numbers of fruits and seeds equal to controls within the same growing season. However, we also observed cases of significant overcompensation and undercompensation. In 1985 and 1987, overcompensation occurred in vertebrate-grazed plants that were supplemented with nutrients and growing free of competition. These plants produced 33% to 120% more fruit than control, ungrazed plants. Cases of undercompensation occurred in groups where I. arizonica grew in association with grasses or where nutrients were not supplemented. Grazed and clipped plants in these groups produced from 28% to 82% as many fruits as did ungrazed controls. Our studies indicate that the compensatory response of plants to grazing is probabilistic when three external factors are considered. The probability of compensation for herbivory decreases as competition with other plants increases, as nutrient levels decrease, and as the timing of herbivory comes later in the growing season.","AMERICAN NATURALIST ","en",1989,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1086/284962","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/284962","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The evolution of resistance and tolerance to herbivores.","Eunice Kariñho-Betancourt","Juan Núñez-Farfán","Tolerance and resistance are two different plant defense strategies against herbivores. Empirical evidence in natural populations reveals that individual plants allocate resources simultaneously to both strategies, thus plants exhibit a mixed pattern of defense. In this review we examine the conditions that promote the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies in the light of available empirical and theoretical evidence. Given that plant tolerance and resistance are heritable and subject to environmentally dependent selection and genetic constraints, the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance is analyzed, with consideration of multiple species interactions and the plant mating system. The existence of mixed defense strategies in plants makes it necessary to re-explore the coevolutionary process between plants and herbivores, which centered historically on resistance as the only defensive mechanism. In addition, we recognize briefly the potential use of plant tolerance for pest management.

"Differential costs of two distinct resistance mechanisms induced by different herbivore species in Arabidopsis. ","Nawaporn Onkokesung","Marcel Dicke","Plants respond to herbivory with the induction of resistance, mediated by distinct phytohormonal signaling pathways and their interactions. Phloem feeders are known to induce plant resistance via the salicylic acid pathway, whereas biting-chewing herbivores induce plant resistance mainly via the jasmonate pathway. Here, we show that a specialist caterpillar (biting-chewing herbivore) and a specialist aphid (phloem feeder) differentially induce resistance against Pieris brassicae caterpillars in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Caterpillar feeding induces resistance through the jasmonate signaling pathway that is associated with the induction of kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside, whereas aphid feeding induces resistance via a novel mechanism involving sinapoyl malate. The role of sinapoyl malate is confirmed through the use of a mutant compromised in the biosynthesis of this compound. Caterpillar-induced resistance is associated with a lower cost in terms of plant growth reduction than aphid-induced resistance. A strong constitutive resistance against P. brassicae caterpillars in combination with a strong growth attenuation in plants of a transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant of WRKY70 (wrky70) suggest that the WRKY70 transcription factor, a regulator of downstream responses mediated by jasmonate-salicylic acid signaling cross talk, is involved in the negative regulation of caterpillar resistance and in the tradeoff between growth and defense. In conclusion, different mechanisms of herbivore-induced resistance come with different costs, and a functional WRKY70 transcription factor is required for the induction of low-cost resistance.","PLANT PHYSIOLOGY","en",2016,"Feb","UK","The Netherlands","10.1104/pp.151780","https://doi.org/10.1104%2Fpp.15.01780","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","England","European Arabidopsis Stock Centre.","Keywords + : NDIRECT PLANT DEFENSE;JASMONIC ACIDSALICYLIC-ACID;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION;GENE-EXPRESSION;GLUCOSINOLATE BIOSYNTHESIS;STRESS-RESPONSE;INSECT;ACCUMULATION"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Beneficial microbes in a changing environment: Are they always helping plants to deal with insects?","Ana Pineda","María J. Pozo","Plants have a complex immune system that defends them against attackers (e.g. herbivores and microbial pathogens) but that also regulates the interactions with mutualistic organisms (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth‐promoting rhizobacteria). Plants have to respond to multiple environmental challenges, so they need to integrate both signals associated with biotic and abiotic stresses in the most appropriate response to survive.Beneficial microbes such as rhizobacteria and mycorrhizal fungi can help plants to ‘deal’ with pathogens and herbivorous insects as well as to tolerate abiotic stress. Therefore, beneficial microbes may play an important role in a changing environment, where abiotic and biotic stresses on plants are expected to increase. The effects of beneficial microbes on herbivores are highly context‐dependent, but little is known on what is driving such dependency. Recent evidence shows that abiotic stresses such as changes in soil nutrients, drought and salt stress, as well as ozone can modify the outcome of plant–microbe–insect interactions.Here, we review how abiotic stress can affect plant–microbe, plant–insect and plant–microbe–insect interactions, and the role of the network of plant signal‐transduction pathways in regulating such interactions.Most of the studies on the effects of abiotic stress on plant–microbe–insect interactions show that the effects of microbes on herbivores (positive or negative) are strengthened under stressful conditions. We propose that, at least in part, this is due to the crosstalk of the different plant signalling pathways triggered by each stress individually. By understanding the cross‐regulation mechanisms we may be able to predict the possible outcomes of plant‐microbe–insect interactions under particular abiotic stress conditions. We also propose that microbes can help plants to deal with insects mainly under conditions that compromise efficient activation of plant defences.In the context of global change, it is crucial to understand how abiotic stresses will affect species interactions, especially those interactions that are beneficial for plants. The final aim of this review is to stimulate studies unravelling when these ‘beneficial’ microbes really benefit a plant.","Fonctional Ecology","en",2013,"Nov","The Netherlands","Spain","10.1111/1365-2435.12050","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12050","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","abiotic stress;abscisic acid;below- and above-ground interactions;climate change;cross-talk;induced systemic resistance;microbial symbiosis;mycorrhiza;plant growth promoting rhizobacteria;plant signalling  "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Editorial: Above-belowground interactions involving plants, microbes and insects.","Ana Pineda","Ted C. J. Turlings","“Integration” has become a central theme in plant research, and this concept has greatly contributed to the exciting recent advances of our understanding of plant interactions with their environment. Plants in nature interact with a plethora of organisms, from microbes and insects through vertebrates to other plants. While some organisms are detrimental, others have mutualistic interactions with plants. Whereas, plant responses to all these organisms were initially studied separately for aboveground and for belowground domains, nowadays it is accepted that plant interactions belowground orchestrate a cascade of events that affects the interactions of plants with organisms that live aboveground, and vice versa. In parallel, it has become evident that the plants' interactions with both mutualists and antagonists are governed by often similar phytohormonal and metabolic responses, which starting at the molecular level, shape the ecological interactions that take place in natural and agricultural systems. Beyond the fundamental interest in these interactions, a comprehensive understanding of how plants integrate their responses to microbes and insects below-aboveground, will also contribute to tackle applied concerns such as the development of sustainable crop protection strategies, and the development of novel crop varieties for increasing yield and performance. Integrating plant responses to beneficial and detrimental organisms, from microbes to insects, and using integrative approaches that range from the molecular changes within the plant to the ecological interactions taking place among organisms, will provide a more representative view of the multitude and complexity of interactions in nature. With this Research Topic, we aimed at being integrative, by proposing a wide array of themes, spanning papers dealing with the molecular bases of above-belowground plant-insect-microbe interactions, to more ecological and large-scale work.","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE ","en",2015,"May","The Netherlands","Sweden","10.3389/fpls.20150318","https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00318/full","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","plant defenses;plant-insect interactions;beneficial microbes;root herbivores;signaling pathways;multitrophic interactions;phytohormones;induced resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Signal molecules mediate the impact of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa on growth, development and defence of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ruben Puga-Freitas","Manuel Blouin","Earthworms have generally a positive impact on plant growth, which is often attributed to a trophic mechanism: namely, earthworms increase the release of mineral nutrients from soil litter and organic matter. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed since the discovery of a signal molecule (Indole Acetic Acid) in earthworm faeces. In this study, we used methodologies developed in plant science to gain information on ecological mechanisms involved in plant-earthworm interaction, by looking at plant response to earthworm presence at a molecular level. First, we looked at plant overall response to earthworm faeces in an in vitro device where only signal molecules could have an effect on plant growth; we observed that earthworms were inducing positive or negative effects on different plant species. Then, using an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with an impaired auxin transport, we demonstrated the potential of earthworms to stimulate root growth and to revert the dwarf mutant phenotype. Finally, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana in the presence and absence of earthworms; we found that genes modulated in the presence of earthworms are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, or to the application of exogenous hormones. A comparison of our results with other studies found in databases revealed strong analogies with systemic resistance, induced by signal molecules emitted by Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria and/or elicitors emitted by non-virulent pathogens. Signal molecules such as auxin and ethylene, which are considered as major in plant-microorganisms interactions, can also be of prior importance to explain plant-macroinvertebrates interactions.

The absence of plant genetic resistance and efficient fungicide against this disease calls for the development of alternative management strategies such as the use of biological control agents. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa can control this plant pathogen by changing soil pH, inducing plant defence mechanisms or improving plant nutrition. Towards this aim, soil chemical properties, plant production, morphology and transcriptome were assessed in the different treatments to characterize the effects of Ggt, earthworm and the interaction between them. Sixty three days after sowing, Ggt was responsible for a strong reduction in fine root proportion and leaf area, and an 82 % decrease in plant total biomass. Earthworms reduced infection rate by 63 % and improved plant growth, which was not significantly different from the no-pathogen control. Neither changes in soil pH, plant defence mechanisms or plant nutrition were proved to be involved in this effect. It was concluded that A. caliginosa was a very efficient biocontrol agent against Ggt and that the mechanism responsible for this biocontrol effect could be associated with microbial community modifications or fungal consumption by earthworms.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY","en",2015,"Sep","France","France","10.1007/s10658-015-0759-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0759-8","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","France","N/A","Aporrectodea caliginosa;Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici;Defence mechanisms;Take-all;Transcriptome;Triticum aestivum (winter wheat)"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Effects of life history, domestication and agronomic selection on plant defence against insects: Evidence from maizes and wild relatives.","Joshua P. Rosenthal","Rodolfo Dirzo","Plant domestication and agronomic selection for increased yield may have an associated effect of reducing plant defence against herbivorous insects. This hypothesis is based on evidence for a metabolic cost associated with defence, and on evidence that increases in yield generally come from the re-partitioning of photoassimilates rather than from fundamental increases in photosynthetic rates. We propose that for plants in which domestication and crop development constitute strong selection for increased growth and reproduction, reallocation of resources may result in lower defence against insects. We examine this hypothesis by means of comparative studies of growth, reproduction and resistance in a complex of maizes and closely related wild taxa, the teosintes. The results of these studies are consistent with assumptions of differential investment in growth and reproduction between wild and domesticated plants. A wild perennial grew slowest and had lowest grain production, while a modern cultivar grew fastest and had the highest grain yield. A wild annual and a land-race cultivar were intermediate. Damage from a diverse assemblage of folivorous insects, and from a specialist stemboring lepidopteran larva, fit the defence predictions closely. A gradient of attack levels suggests that the wild perennial is most defended, followed in descending order by the wild annual, the land-race cultivar and the modern high-yielding variety. Alternative hypotheses for this pattern are consistent with some, but not all, of our data.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",1997,"May","USA","USA","10.1023/a:1018420504439","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1018420504439","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Mexico","N/A","cost of defence;Diatraea grandiosella growth rate;Mexico;resource allocation;Zea spp"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

While subsequent damage levels, when corrected for differences in plant size, were highest in the wild perennial, Zea diploperennis, this taxon showed the lowest absolute and proportional reductions in growth and reproduction, i.e., it was most tolerant to the damage. Higher growth rates were not associated with tolerance. Rather, a greater number of tillers and leaves in the wild taxa allowed for compartmentalization of damage and greater developmental plasticity. These results, when combined with previous findings on effective defense patterns, indicate that tolerance in maizes and wild relatives may be positively associated with defense against stemboring by the same insect. Because the probable mechanisms for defense (tissue fiber) and tolerance (plant architecture) are unrelated, a positive association is contrary to the predictions of some optimal defense theories, which posit a negative relationship between tolerance and defense.","Oecologia","en",1995,"May","USA","USA","10.1007/bf00333245","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00333245","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Mexico","southwest Mexico","Compensatory growth;Zea Domestication;Defense trade-offs;Stemborer"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of earthworms on plant growth: Patterns and perspectives.","Stefan Scheu","Stefan Scheu","A total of 67 studies were located in which the response of plants to presence of earthworms was investigated. The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","PEDOBIOLOGIA ","en",2003,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1078/0031-4056-00270","http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0031-4056-00270","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (67 studies)","Various","Lumbricidae;rhizosphere;animal-plant interactions;indirect effects;food-web"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Links between the detritivore and the herbivore system: Effects of earthworms and Collembola on plant growth and aphid development.","Stefan Scheu","T. Hefin Jones","Effects of Collembola (Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus scotarius) and earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion tyrtaeum) on the growth of two plant species from different functional groups (Poa anna and Trifolium repens), and on the development of aphids (Myzus persicae) were investigated in a laboratory experiment lasting 20 weeks. Using soil from a fallow site which had been set aside for about 15 years, we expected that nitrogen would be of limited supply to plants and hypothesized that the soil animals studied, particularly earthworms, would increase nutrient availability to plants and thereby also modify aphid reproduction and development. Plant growth was modified strongly by the presence of soil animals. Earthworms caused a more than twofold increase in shoot and root mass of P. annua but increased that of T. repens by only 18% and 6%, respectively. However, earthworms neither affected plant shoot/root ratio nor the nitrogen concentration in plant tissue. In contrast, the presence of Collembola caused a reduction in plant biomass particularly that of P. annua roots, but plant tissue nitrogen concentration was increased, although only slightly. Aphid reproduction on T. repens was lowered in the presence of Collembola on average by 45% but on P. annua increased by a factor of about 3. It is concluded that Collembola decrease aphid reproduction on more palatable host plants like T. repens but increase that on less palatable ones like P. annua. Earthworm presence also affected aphid reproduction but the effect was less consistent than that of Collembola. In the presence of earthworms, aphid reproduction was in one experimental period increased by some 70%. Earthworms also modified the numbers of Collembola and their vertical distribution in experimental chambers. Exploitation of deeper soil layers by H. nitidus was increased but, generally, O. scotarius numbers were reduced whereas those of H. nitidus increased in earthworm treatments. The presence of Collembola also influenced earthworm body mass during the experiment. In general it declined, but in the presence of Collembola loss of body mass of A. caliginosa was more pronounced. We conclude that inhibiting effects between Collembola and earthworms resulted from the use of a common resource, litter material rich in nitrogen. This is supported by the higher C/N ratio of the litter material in the presence of earthworms and Collembola by the end of the experiment. Effects of soil invertebrates like Collembola and earthworms on plant performance and aphid development are assumed to be modified by complex direct and indirect interactions among soil animal groups.","OECOLOGIA ","en",1999,"Jun","Germany","Wales","10.1007/s004420050817","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050817","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Göttingen ","soil fauna;soil food web;herbivores;Lumbricidae;springtails "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Insect-plant biology","Louis M Schoonhoven","Marcel Dicke","Half of all insect species are dependent on living plant tissues, consuming about 10% of plant annual production in natural habitats and an even greater percentage in agricultural systems, despite sophisticated control measures. Plants possess defences that are effective against almost all herbivorous insect species. Host-plant specialization, observed in over 80% of these animals, appears to be an effective adaptation to breach these defence systems. The mechanisms underlying plant defence to invading herbivores on the one side, and insect adaptations to utilize plants for nutrition, defence and shelter on the other, are the main subjects of this book. In the case of plants exposed to insect herbivores, they include the activation of defence systems in order to minimize damage, as well as the emission of chemical signals that may attract natural enemies of the invading herbivores and may be exploited by neighbouring plants that mount defences as well. For insects, they include complex bevioural adaptations and their underlying sensory systems (with their implications for learning and nutritional plasticity), as well as the endocrinological aspects of life cycle synchronization with host-plant phenology.  Insect-Plant Biology discusses the operation of these mechanisms at the molecular and organismal levels and explicitly puts these in the context of both ecological interactions and evolutionary processes. In doing so, it uncovers the highly intricate antagonistic as well as mutualistic interactions that have evolved between plants and insects. The book concludes with a chapter on the application of our knowledge of insect-plant interactions to agricultural production.  This multidisciplinary approach will appeal to students in biology, agricultural entomology, ecology, and indeed anyone interested in the principles underlying the relationships between the two largest groups of organisms on earth: plants and insects.","Book","en",2005,"Dec","The Netherlands ","The Netherlands ","10.1093/oso/978019852594301001","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31846359_Insect-Plant_Biology","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various ","Various","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Land-use and land-management change: Relationships with earthworm and fungi communities and soil structural properties.","David J Spurgeon","Jack H Faber","Background: Change in land use and management can impact massively on soil ecosystems. Ecosystem engineers and other functional biodiversity in soils can be influenced directly by such change and this in turn can affect key soil functions. Here, we employ meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of changes in land use and land management across a range of successional/extensification transitions (conventional arable -> no or reduced tillage -> grassland -> wooded land) on community metrics for two functionally important soil taxa, earthworms and fungi. An analysis of the relationships between community change and soil structural properties was also included.  Results: Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased earthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity and later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such as introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all changes, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether woodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on woodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during conversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil structure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group composition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on tillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were positively associated with soil microaggregate stability.  Conclusions: These findings raise the potential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation to regulation of soil structure and water flow.","BMC ECOLOGY ","en",2013,"Dec","UK","The Netherlands","10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (met-analysis)","Various","Meta analysis;Earthworm;Fungi;Functional biodiversity;Soil porosity;Microaggregate stability"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Plant interactions with multiple insect herbivores: From community to genes.","Jeltje M. Stam","Marcel Dicke","Every plant is a member of a complex insect community that consists of tens to hundreds of species that belong to different trophic levels. The dynamics of this community are critically influenced by the plant, which mediates interactions between community members that can occur on the plant simultaneously or at different times. Herbivory results in changes in the plant's morphological or chemical phenotype that affect interactions with subsequently arriving herbivores. Changes in the plant's phenotype are mediated by molecular processes such as phytohormonal signaling networks and transcriptomic rearrangements that are initiated by oral secretions of the herbivore. Processes at different levels of biological complexity occur at timescales ranging from minutes to years. In this review, we address plant-mediated interactions with multiple species of the associated insect community and their effects on community dynamics, and link these to the mechanistic effects that multiple attacks have on plant phenotypes.","ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT BIOLOGY ","en",2014,"Jan","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937","http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A","phenotypic plasticity;trait-mediated interaction networks;phytohormones;systems biology;species interactions"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Autoecological factors, as well as the influence of competitors and mutualists, affect the level of plant tolerance.

Investigations of the physiological and morphological changes that occur in plants in response to herbivore damage have identified several potential mechanisms of tolerance. However, it is unlikely that all physiological changes that occur following damage are tolerance mechanisms. Few studies have made direct comparisons between the expression of tolerance and the relative expression of putative mechanisms. I briefly review empirical evidence for some of the better-studied potential mechanisms, including increased photosynthetic activity, compensatory growth, utilization of stored reserves, and phenological delays. For each of these mechanisms I discuss reasons why the relationship between tolerance and these characters may be more complicated than it first appears. I conclude by discussing several empirical approaches, including herbivore manipulations, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, and selection experiments, that will further our understanding of tolerance mechanisms.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",2000,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1023/a:1010881317261","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1010881317261","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (review)","Various ","compensation;empirical approaches;herbivory;plant defense;plant–herbivore interaction;tolerance mechanisms "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Herbivory of an invasive slug in a model grassland community can be affected by earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi.","Raphaël Trouvé","Johann G. Zaller","Invasion of non-native species is among the top threats for the biodiversity and functioning of native and agricultural ecosystems worldwide. We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms-Annelida: Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-AMF, Glomerales). We hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites, AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 % (P < 0.001). Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community structure.","BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS ","en",2013,"Jun","Australia","Austria","10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Autria","University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU)","Aboveground-belowground interactions;Gastropods;Invasive species;Lumbricidae;Neobiota;Plant-soil interactions;Soil ecology;Symbiotic fungi"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms increase plant production: A meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","England","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Agroecology;Ecosystem services "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The myriad plant responses to herbivores.","Linda L. Walling","Linda L. Walling","Plant responses to herbivores are complex. Genes activated on herbivore attack are strongly correlated with the mode of herbivore feeding and the degree of tissue damage at the feeding site. Phloem-feeding whiteflies and aphids that produce little injury to plant foliage are perceived as pathogens and activate the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent and jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene-dependent signaling pathways. Differential expression of plant genes in response to closely related insect species suggest that some elicitors generated by phloem-feeding insects are species-specific and are dependent on the herbivore's developmental stage. Other elicitors for defense-gene activation are likely to be more ubiquitous. Analogies to the pathogen-incompatible reactions are found. Chewing insects such as caterpillars and beetles and cell-content feeders such as mites and thrips cause more extensive tissue damage and activate wound-signaling pathways. Herbivore feeding is not equivalent to mechanical wounding. Wound responses ape a part of the induced responses that accompany herbivore feeding. Herbivores induce direct defenses that interfere with herbivore feeding, growth and development, fecundity, and fertility. In addition, herbivores induce an array of volatiles that creates an indirect mechanism of defense. Volatile blends provide specific cues to attract herbivore parasites and predators to infested plants. The nature of the elicitors for volatile production is discussed.","JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION ","en",2000,"Jun","USA","USA","10.1007/s003440000026","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003440000026","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","phloem-feeding insects;jasmonic acid;pathogenesis-related proteins;ethylene;saliva;signal transduction;salicylic acid;defense;chewing insects;wounding"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Domestication impacts on plant-herbivore interactions: A meta-analysis.","Susan R. Whitehead","Katja Poveda","For millennia, humans have imposed strong selection on domesticated crops, resulting in drastically altered crop phenotypes compared with wild ancestors. Crop yields have increased, but a long-held hypothesis is that domestication has also unintentionally decreased plant defences against herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis comparing insect herbivore resistance and putative plant defence traits between crops and their wild relatives. Our database included 2098 comparisons made across 73 crops in 89 studies. We found that domestication consistently reduced plant resistance to herbivores, although the magnitude of the effects varied across plant organs and depended on how resistance was measured. However, domestication had no consistent effects on the specific plant defence traits underlying resistance, including secondary metabolites and physical feeding barriers. The values of these traits sometimes increased and sometimes decreased during domestication. Consistent negative effects of domestication were observed only when defence traits were measured in reproductive organs or in the plant organ that was harvested. These results highlight the complexity of evolution under domestication and the need for an improved theoretical understanding of the mechanisms through which agronomic selection can influence the species interactions that impact both the yield and sustainability of our food systems.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences’.","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2017,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1098/rstb.2016034","https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0034","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","agronomic selection;crop yield;herbivore resistance;plant defence theory;resource allocation;secondary metabolites"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of earthworms on above- and below-ground herbivores.","Susanne Wurst","Susanne Wurst","Earthworms affect plant performance and can influence plant–herbivore interactions. Both primary and secondary metabolites and the expression of stress-responsive genes of plants can be affected by earthworms. Plant-mediated effects of earthworms on aboveground herbivore performance range between positive and negative. These indirect, plant-mediated effects likely depend on the altered resource uptake of plants or changes in the soil microbial community composition in presence of earthworms. Studies on belowground interactions between earthworms and root herbivores focussed almost exclusively on root-feeding nematodes. These interactions can be either direct (e.g. ingesting of nematodes) or indirect, mediated by changes in host plant performance or biotic and abiotic soil characteristics. Earthworms were documented to counteract the negative effects of root-feeding nematodes on plants. Consistently, earthworm-worked soils (vermicompost) have been reported to reduce numbers of root-feeding nematodes and plant damage by aboveground herbivores. The results suggest context dependent impacts of earthworms on herbivore performance and an alleviation of herbivore damage of plants by earthworms, besides their well-known effects on plant growth.

Detritivorous soil fauna, though ubiquitous and present in high abundances and biomasses in soil, are under-represented in those studies. Understanding of their impact on plants is mainly restricted to growth and nutrient uptake parameters. Detritivores have been shown to affect secondary metabolites and defense gene expression in aboveground parts of plants, with potential impacts on aboveground plant-herbivore interactions. The proposed mechanisms range from nutrient mobilization effects and impacts on soil microorganisms to defense induction by passive or active ingestion of roots. Since their negative effects (disruption or direct feeding of roots) may be counterbalanced by their overall beneficial effects (nutrient mobilization), detritivores may not harm, but rather enable plants to respond to aboveground herbivore attacks in a more efficient way.

"Earthworms counterbalance the negative effect of microorganisms on plant diversity and enhance the tolerance of grasses to nematodes.","Susanne Wurst","Wim H. Van Der Putten","Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non‐leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, butLotus corniculatusflowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant‐feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities.","OIKOS ","en",2008,"May","Germany","The Netherlands","10.1111/j030-1299.2008.16333.x","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40235358","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","The Netherlands","Mossel","Keywords +;GROUND INSECT HERBIVORY;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;SOIL;SUCCESSION;PERFORMANCE;LUMBRICIDAE;DETERMINANT;COLLEMBOLA"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Earthworms did not affect VAM root colonization. Earthworms enhanced shoot biomass, and VAM reduced root biomass. VAM increased plant phosphorus content, but reduced the total amount of N in leaves. Earthworms led to a preferential uptake of soil N compared with N-15 from the added grass residues in the absence of VAM. Earthworm presence reduced the concentration of catalpol. Earthworms and VAM combined accelerated the development of M. persicae, while the development tended to be delayed when only VAM or earthworms were present.

"Effects of earthworms and organic litter distribution on plant performance and aphid reproduction.","Susanne Wurst","Stefan Scheu","Human management practices and large detritivores such as earthworms incorporate plant litter into the soil, thereby forming a heterogeneous soil environment from which plant roots extract nutrients. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated effects of earthworms and spatial distribution of N-15-labelled grass litter on plants of different functional groups [Lolium perenne (grass), Plantago lanceolata (forb), Trifolium repens (legume)]. Earthworms enhanced shoot and root growth in L. perenne and P. lanceolata and N uptake from organic litter and soil in all plant species. Litter concentrated in a patch (compared with litter mixed homogeneously into the soil) increased shoot biomass and N-15 uptake from the litter in L. perenne and enhanced root proliferation in P. lanceolata when earthworms were present. Growth of clover (T. repens) was rather independent of the presence of earthworms and organic litter distribution: nevertheless, clover took up more nitrogen in the presence of earthworms and exploited more N-15 from the added litter than the other plant species. The magnitude of the effects of earthworms and organic litter distribution differed between the plant species, indicating different responses of plants with contrasting root morphology.

"Earthworms affect plant growth and resistance against herbivores: A meta-analysis.","Zhenggao Xiao","Sergio Rasmann","Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities. A number of recent studies have explored whether these changes caused by earthworms may in turn affect plant performance and resistance to herbivores, but no formal synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a meta‐analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.A plain language  is available for this article.","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","en",2017,"Nov","China","Switzerland","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12969","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","chemical defences;detritivore diversity;endogeic earthworms;herbivore-feeding guilds;meta-analysis;plant growth-defence trade-off;plant nutrients;plant resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Deposition and decomposition of cattle dung and its impact on soil properties and plant growth in a cool-temperate pasture.","Shinpei Yoshitake","Hiroshi Koizumi","Livestock dung provides an important direct pathway by which carbon and nutrients enter soils in pasture ecosystems and affects carbon and nitrogen cycling indirectly through changes in soil and plant properties. Here, we quantify dung deposition, decomposition, and the effects of dung on soil and plants in a Zoysia japonica grassland in Japan. We determined (1) the distribution of dung, (2) the mass loss rate of dung and the amount of carbon respired as CO2, and (3) changes in soil properties and aboveground biomass of Z. japonica. Dung deposition was 4–9.7 g C and 0.4–1 g N m−2 yea−1 and distributed patchily (Morishita's Iδ &gt; 1). Most (71 %) of the carbon in dung deposited in June was lost within a single grazing period by aerobic decomposition, more than mass loss rate of Z. japonica litter in the first year (about 50 %), suggesting that grazing and defecation can accelerate carbon cycling compared with the typical litterfall–decomposition regime. Nitrogen in dung mass entered the soil as ammonium nitrogen and was nitrified. The spatiotemporal distribution of these processes corresponded to that of stimulated Z. japonica growth. These results suggested that dung deposition significantly affected the inorganic nitrogen status of soil and, therefore, the growth of Z. japonica. However, these effects were very restricted temporally (July–August) and spatially (within 10 cm from dung edge). Thus, such spatiotemporally restricted effects combined with the patchy distribution of dung may contribute to the heterogeneous structure of pasture ecosystems.","ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH","en",2014,"Jul","Japan","Japan","10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Japan","36°08′N, 137°25′E, about 1300–1350 m","Carbon and nitrogen cycling;Dung decomposition;Grassland;Pasture;Plant growth"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Mechanisms and evolution of plant resistance to aphids.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Aphids are important herbivores of both wild and cultivated plants. Plants rely on unique mechanisms of recognition, signalling and defence to cope with the specialized mode of phloem feeding by aphids. Aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying aphid-plant interactions are beginning to be understood. Recent advances include the identification of aphid salivary proteins involved in host plant manipulation, and plant receptors involved in aphid recognition. However, a complete picture of aphid-plant interactions requires consideration of the ecological outcome of these mechanisms in nature, and the evolutionary processes that shaped them. Here we identify general patterns of resistance, with a special focus on recognition, phytohormonal signalling, secondary metabolites and induction of plant resistance. We discuss how host specialization can enable aphids to co-opt both the phytohormonal responses and defensive compounds of plants for their own benefit at a local scale. In response, systemically induced resistance in plants is common and often involves targeted responses to specific aphid species or even genotypes. As co-evolutionary adaptation between plants and aphids is ongoing, the stealthy nature of aphid feeding makes both the mechanisms and outcomes of these interactions highly distinct from those of other herbivore-plant interactions.","NATURE PLANTS ","en",2016,"Jan","Switzerland","USA","10.1038/nplants.2015.206","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nplants.2015.206","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","Jasmonic acid;Plant ecology;Plant evolution;Secondary metabolism;Structural variation "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Trade-offs between plant growth and defense against insect herbivory: An emerging mechanistic synthesis.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Costs of defense are central to our understanding of interactions between organisms and their environment, and defensive phenotypes of plants have long been considered to be constrained by trade-offs that reflect the allocation of limiting resources. Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory “decisions” by the plant, enabling it to fine-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth–defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant's allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs.

Four of the seven defence mutants had significantly higher size-standardized growth rates (SGRs) than the wild-type in early life, although this benefit declined as plants grew larger. SGR is known to be a good predictor of success under high-density conditions, and we confirmed that mutants with higher growth rates had a large advantage when grown in competition. Despite the lack of differences in flowering-time genes, the mutants differed in flowering time, a trait that strongly correlated with early growth rate. Aphid herbivory decreased plant growth rate and increased flowering time, and aphid population growth rate was closely coupled to the growth rate of the host plant. Small differences in early SGR thus had cascading effects on both flowering time and herbivore populations.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2011,"Sep","Switzerland","England","10.1098/rspb.2010.2475","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.2475","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","herbivore defences;size-standardized growth rate;glucosinolates;trichomes;Arabidopsis"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Growth-defense tradeoffs for two major anti-herbivore traits of the common milkweed Asclepias syriaca.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Costs of plant defense are a key assumption in evolutionary ecology, yet their detection has remained challenging. Here we introduce a novel method for quantifying plant growth using the common milkweed Asclepias syriaca and repeated non‐destructive size measurements to experimentally test for costs of defensive traits. We estimated mechanistic components of plant growth (relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area and leaf‐mass ratio) at two levels of fertilization (high and low), and related them to production of toxic cardenolides and exudation of sticky latex. We found negative genetic correlations between cardenolides and growth (most strongly with net assimilation rate) at both nutrient levels. Additionally, plants varied in their cardenolide response to low nutrients, and genetic families maintaining higher cardenolide production at low nutrient availability suffered proportionally larger reductions in growth. In contrast, the amount of latex was positively correlated with plant growth. Because latex is instantly deployed from a plant‐wide system of pressurized laticifers, larger plants may simply exude proportionally more latex when damaged and thus plant size is likely to mask potential costs of latex synthesis. Unbiased quantification of mechanistic growth processes, coupled with the manipulation of nutrient or stress levels, is thus an effective approach to demonstrate allocation to defense and tradeoffs with growth, especially in long‐lived plant species.","OIKOS ","en",2015,"Oct","Switzerland ","USA","10.1111/oik2075","https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.02075","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","USA","Tompkins County, New York","Keywords +: PLANT DEFENSE;FITNESS COSTS;CARDENOLIDES;COEVOLUTION;COMPONENTS;RESISTANCE;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;MODELS;RATES"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The unseen invaders: introduced earthworms as drivers of change in plant communities in North American forests (a meta-analysis)","Dylan Craven","Nico Eisenhauer","Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning. While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests.

"Different earthworm ecological groups interactively impact seedling establishment.","Roman Asshoff","Nico Eisenhauer","There is increasing evidence that direct interactions between earthworms and seeds impact the assembly of plant communities. However, effects of earthworms of different ecological groups and their interactions on plant germination and establishment are little known. We set up a full-factorial greenhouse experiment in order to explore impacts of different ecological groups of earthworms (epigeic, endogeic and anecic) on the establishment of seedlings. The three ecological groups of earthworms affected seedling establishment in an interactive way with the effects varying in time. While anecic earthworms detrimentally affected the number of established seedlings, impacts of epigeic and endogeic species depended on the presence of earthworms belonging to other ecological groups. Impacts of anecic earthworms were more significant and consistent than those of epigeic and endogeic ones pointing to the dominance of the effect of anecic earthworms for seedling establishment. The initial positive effect of the combined presence of epigeic and endogeic earthworms compared to treatments with only endogeic and only anecic earthworms was likely due to the acceleration of seed germination and elevated nutrient availability for seedlings in earthworm casts. By contrast, reduced numbers of seedlings in presence of both epigeic and endogeic earthworms compared to the control treatment might have been due to seedling predation after the litter layer had disappeared. The results extend current knowledge on interactions between earthworms and seeds by showing that, in addition to anecic species, also epigeic and endogeic species influence seedling establishment with their effect depending on the presence of anecic species. Moreover, the results indicate that impacts of earthworms vary with the developmental stage of seedlings highlighting the importance of interactions between earthworms and seeds.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY ","en",2010,"Sep_Oct","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.ejsobi.2010605","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2010.06.005","10.1111/gcb.13446","Germany","North Rhine-Westphalia","Anecic earthworms;Endogeic earthworms;Epigeic earthworms;Germination;Grassland Seeds;The Jena experiment","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Historical anthropogenic disturbances influence patterns of non-native earthworm and plant invasions in a temperate primary forest.","Robin Beauséjour","Mark Vellend","Time lags are of potentially great importance during biological invasions. For example, significant delays can occur between the human activities permitting the arrival of an invader, the establishment of this new species, and the manifestation of its impacts. In this context, to assess the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, it may become necessary to include a historical perspective. In this study, we reconstructed the history of human activities in a temperate forest now protected as a nature reserve to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the impact of human disturbances (e.g. trails, old quarries), as well as environmental factors, in explaining the probability of occurrence and the intensity of invasion by non-native earthworms and plants. The present-day patterns of distribution and intensity of earthworms and plants were better explained by proximity to the oldest human disturbances (initiated more than a century ago) than by proximity to more recent disturbances or to all disturbances combined. We conclude that understanding present-day patterns of non-native species invasions may often require reconstructing the history of human disturbances that occurred decades or even centuries in the past.","Biological Invasions ","en",2015,"Avr","Canada","Canada","10.1007/s10530-014-0794-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0794-y","10.1111/gcb.13446","Canada","Gault Nature Reserve","Human activities;Ecological legacies;Nature reserve;Lumbricidae;Taraxacum officinalis;Historical ecology;Time lag","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Research on earthworm invasions has focused on changes in soil structure and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling that occur following invasion. These changes include the mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons, decreases in soil C storage, and equivocal effects on N cycling. Less well studied are changes in the soil foodwebs that accompany earthworm invasion. Soils of north temperate forests harbor a tremendous diversity of microorganisms and invertebrates, whose distribution and abundance can be substantially altered by earthworm invasion. Furthermore, invasive earthworms can affect understory plant communities, raising concerns over the loss of rare native herbs in some areas. The ecological consequences of earthworm invasion are mediated through physical, geochemical, and biological effects. These effects vary with different earthworm species, as well as with the characteristics of the site being invaded.

"What limits trees in c4 grasslands and savannas?","William J. Bond","William J. Bond","Though the distribution of global vegetation can generally be predicted from climate, grasslands are an exception. C4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire, herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C4 grassy biomes.

"How do earthworms affect microfloral and faunal community diversity?","George G. Brown","George G. Brown","Much of the work regarding earthworm effects on other organisms has focused on the functional significance of microbial-earthworm interactions, and little is known on the effects of earthworms on microfloral and faunal diversity. Earthworms can affect soil microflora and fauna populations directly and indirectly by three main mechanisms: (1) comminution, burrowing and casting; (2) grazing; (3) dispersal. These activities change the soil's physico-chemical and biological status and may cause drastic shifts in the density, diversity, structure and activity of microbial and faunal communities within the drilosphere. Certain organisms and species may be enhanced, reduced or not be affected at all depending on their ability to adapt to the particular conditions of different earthworm drilospheres. A large host of factors (including CaCO3, enzymes, mucus and antimicrobial substances) influence the ability of preferentially or randomly ingested organisms to survive (or not) passage through the earthworm gut, and their resultant capacity to recover and proliferate (or not) in earthworm casts. Small organisms, particularly microflora and microfauna, with limited ability to move within the soil, may benefit from the (comparatively) long ranging movements of earthworms. Microflora and smaller fauna appear to be particularly sensitive to earthworm activities, and priming effects enhancing nutrient release, particularly in casts, are common. Larger fauna such as microarthropods, enchytraeids and Isopods may be enhanced under some conditions (e.g., in earthworm middens), but in other cases earthworm activity may lead to a decrease in their populations due to competition for food (microbes and organic materials), and spatial and temporal changes in food abundance. Nevertheless, considering the presently available data, the beneficial interactions of earthworms and microflora and fauna appear to far outweigh the potential negative effects. However, much is still unknown regarding the interactions of earthworms of different ecological categories on the diversity and function of microfloral and faunal communities, and much more interdisciplinary research is needed to assess the potential role of earthworms in regulating the diversity of microflora and fauna in soil systems and the potentially beneficial or harmful effects this regulation may have on ecosystem function and plant growth in different ecosystems.","Plant and soil ","en",1995,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","USA","diversity;earthworms;soil fauna;soil microflora;soil processes ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Root foraging influences plant growth responses to earthworm foraging.","Erin K. Cameron","Erin M. Bayne","Interactions among the foraging behaviours of co-occurring animal species can impact population and community dynamics; the consequences of interactions between plant and animal foraging behaviours have received less attention. In North American forests, invasions by European earthworms have led to substantial changes in plant community composition. Changes in leaf litter have been identified as a critical indirect mechanism driving earthworm impacts on plants. However, there has been limited examination of the direct effects of earthworm burrowing on plant growth. Here we show a novel second pathway exists, whereby earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.) impact plant root foraging. In a minirhizotron experiment, roots occurred more frequently in burrows and soil cracks than in the soil matrix. The roots of Achillea millefolium L. preferentially occupied earthworm burrows, where nutrient availability was presumably higher than in cracks due to earthworm excreta. In contrast, the roots of Campanula rotundifolia L. were less likely to occur in burrows. This shift in root behaviour was associated with a 30% decline in the overall biomass of C. rotundifolia when earthworms were present. Our results indicate earthworm impacts on plant foraging can occur indirectly via physical and chemical changes to the soil and directly via root consumption or abrasion and thus may be one factor influencing plant growth and community change following earthworm invasion. More generally, this work demonstrates the potential for interactions to occur between the foraging behaviours of plants and soil animals and emphasizes the importance of integrating behavioural understanding in foraging studies involving plants.","PLOS ONE ","en",2014,"Sep","Canada","Canada","10.1371/journal.pone108873","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108873","10.1111/gcb.13446","Canada","boreal forest of northeastern Alberta (54°36′N, 110° 59′W)","Earthworms;Foraging;Animal behavior;Invasive species;Leaves;Plant-herbivore interactions;Root growth;Species interactions","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global meta-analysis of the impacts of terres trial invertebrate invaders on species, communities and ecosystems.","Erin K. Cameron","Mar Cabeza","Terrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of alien species world‐wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of their effects on native species and ecosystems has not been explored. We conducted a meta‐analysis to examine the ecological impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study methodology (observational versus experimental).LocationGlobal.MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting a random effects meta‐analysis using 112 articles reporting data from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16 insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders.ResultsOn average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant fitness (52%), animal diversity (33%) and animal abundance (29%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41% higher in the presence of invaders, while other ecosystem‐level variables such as nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction. Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance, whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large variation among studies.Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems, with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts. However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader. There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are involved.","Global Ecology and Biogeography","en",2016,"Jan","Finland","Finland","10.1111/geb.12436","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12436","10.1111/gcb.13446","Location: Global (website information)","Various","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive earthworms as seed predators of temperate forest plants.","Colin M. Cassin","Peter M. Kotanen","Soil seedbanks play a key role in forest plant communities, contributing to regeneration and acting as a refuge from seed predators. This study provides evidence that seeds entering the soil seed-bank are vulnerable to granivory by invasive earthworms in temperate forests. Overall, 73 % of seeds of 6 ecologically important forest species were removed from the soil surface over 2 weeks in a Lumbricus terrestris microcosm experiment; 30 % vanished entirely, and presumably were destroyed. The invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, was subject to the highest rates of removal. In contrast, results from a field exclosure experiment using 23 species of seed indicate that while seed predation by worms is still detectable, predation by rodents often may mask impacts of earthworms under natural conditions. Worms and rodents preferred different sizes of seeds: while seed predation by rodents was high in mid-to large-seeded species, earthworms tended to prefer smaller seeds. These findings suggest that although rodents are the main driver of seed predation, invasive earthworms may act as an additional ecological filter, and potentially may further influence the species composition of forest plant communities.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2016,"Jun","Canada","Canada","10.1007/s10530-016-1101-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1101-x","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","Invasive earthworms;Seed predation;Granivory;Seed bank;Lumbricus terrestris;Exotic species","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Non-native earthworms promote plant invasion by ingesting seeds and modifying soil properties.","Julia Clause","Sébastien Barot","Earthworms can have strong direct effects on plant communities through consumption and digestion of seeds, however it is unclear how earthworms may influence the relative abundance and composition of plant communities invaded by non-native species. In this study, earthworms, seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling locations were selected based on historical land-use practices, including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found, dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides. Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with the associated plant community.","ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY ","en",2015,"Apr","France","France","10.1016/j.actao.2015204","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2015.02.004","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","grassland of central California","Invasive species;Californian grassland;Earthworm casts;Feedback;Interactions;Seed bank","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Exotic earthworms of great lakes forests: a search for indicator plant species in maple forests.","Kathryn Corio","Gary Fewless","The invasion of exotic earthworms in previously earthworm-free northern deciduous forests has been linked to the disappearance of forest floor litter, declines in plant species richness, and the development of monotypic stands of Carex pensylvanica. However, the impact of exotic earthworms on the regeneration of trees and understory plants is largely unknown. We examined the relationships between earthworm density, plant species richness, leaf litter accumulation, number of tree (Acer) seedlings, and cover of C. pensylvanica at 14 sites in mesic hardwood forests of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Earthworm biomass, especially of the genera Lumbricus, Aporrectodea, and Octolasion was negatively associated with leaf litter mass and number of Acer seedlings. Nine plant species, including two spring ephemerals (Dicentra cucullaria and Osmorhiza claytonii), a sedge (Carex deweyana), and an invasive mint (Galeopsis tetrahit) were negatively correlated with exotic earthworm densities. Dtyopteris intermedia and Allium tricoccum, on the other hand, were associated with high earthworm densities. The activities of exotic earthworms appear to have significant impacts on Acer regeneration and the persistence of many herbaceous plants. Our findings suggest that the effects of exotic earthworms on litter mass are strongly related to the observed effects on species composition. Sensitive species can be used as indicators of high and low earthworm densities and might be useful for identifying forests of high conservation value where future invasions of exotic earthworms should be prevented.","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT ","en",2009,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.foreco.2009513","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.013","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Vilas, Forest, and Oconto Counties, Wisconsin.","Acer saccharum;Earthworm invasion;Invasive species;Indicator species;Northern hardwood forest","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global diversity of drought tolerance and grassland climate-change resilience.","Joseph M. Craine","Joseph E. Fargione","Drought reduces plant productivity, induces widespread plant mortality and limits the geographic distribution of plant species(1-7). As climates warm and precipitation patterns shift in the future(8,9), understanding the distribution of the diversity of plant drought tolerance is central to predicting future ecosystem function and resilience to climate change(10-12). These questions are especially pressing for the world's 11,000 grass species(13), which dominate a large fraction of the terrestrial biosphere(14), yet are poorly characterized with respect to responses to drought. Here, we show that physiological drought tolerance, which varied tenfold among 426 grass species, is well distributed both climatically and phylogenetically, suggesting most native grasslands are likely to contain a high diversity of drought tolerance. Consequently, local species may help maintain ecosystem functioning in response to changing drought regimes without requiring long-distance migrations of grass species. Furthermore, physiologically drought-tolerant species had higher rates of water and carbon dioxide exchange than intolerant species, indicating that severe droughts may generate legacies for ecosystem functioning. In all, our findings suggest that diverse grasslands throughout the globe have the potential to be resilient to drought in the face of climate change through the local expansion of drought-tolerant species.","NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE ","en",2013,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1038/nclimate1634","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1634","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","N/A","Climate-change ecology;Drought;Grassland ecology ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Single and interactive effects of deer and earth worms on non-native plants.","Andrea Dávalos","Bernd Blossey","Understanding drivers of plant invasions is essential to predict and successfully manage invasions. Across forests in North America, increased white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance and non-native earthworms may facilitate non-native plant invasions. While each agent may exert independent effects, earthworms and deer often co-occur and their combined effects are difficult to predict based solely on knowledge of their individual effects. Using a network of twelve forested sites that differ in earthworm density, we evaluated deer exclusion effects (30 × 30 m; with an adjacent similar sized unfenced control plot) on cover, growth and reproduction of three non-native plant species: Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii and Microstegium vimineum. In addition, we assessed interactive effects of deer exclusion and earthworm invasions on B. thunbergii ring-growth. Five years after fence construction, A. petiolata frequency and density, B. thunbergii height, and M. vimineum cover were all significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots. In addition, B. thunbergii ring-growth was significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots, and ring-growth was positively correlated with earthworm density. Moreover, deer access and earthworm density synergistically interacted resulting in highest B. thunbergii ring-growth in open plots at sites with higher earthworm density. Results indicate facilitative effects of deer on non-native plant species and highlight the importance of understanding interactions among co-occurring factors in order to understand non-native species success. Successful long-term control of invasive plants may require a reduction in deer abundance, rather than just removing invasive plant species.","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT ","en",2015,"Apr","USA","USA","10.1016/j.foreco.2015426","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.026","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","US Army Garrison West Point, New York","Alliaria petiolata;Berberis thunbergii;Dendroecology;Earthworm invasion;Microstegium vimineum;White-tailed deer","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Here, we discuss our current knowledge of aboveground and belowground diversity links from a global to a local scale. Global diversity peaks towards the Equator for large, aboveground organisms, but not for small (mainly belowground) organisms, suggesting that there are size-related biodiversity gradients in global aboveground-belowground linkages. The generalization of aboveground-belowground diversity relationships, and their role in ecosystem functioning, requires surveys at scales that are relevant to the organisms and ecosystem properties. Habitat sizes and diversity gradients can differ significantly between aboveground and belowground organisms and between ecosystems.

Stressor effects are typically tested one at a time; however, stressors often co‐occur and plants respond to effects of multiple stressors simultaneously.We used a factorial design to test independent and combined effects of non‐native earthworms and native white‐tailed deer on survival of seedling transplants of 15 native understorey plants in five forests in New York State.Earthworm biomass was negatively correlated with survival of 12 of 15 species. We found no interactive effect of deer and earthworms, but did find a positive, non‐consumptive effect of deer on Geranium maculatum and Polygonum virginianum survival.Deer and earthworm presence/absence indirectly influenced other trophic levels: earthworm presence increased the likelihood of insect attack, and deer exclusion increased the likelihood of rodent disturbance of transplants.Synthesis. Invasive earthworms negatively affected seedling survival of many understorey plants, including species previously thought to benefit from earthworm associations. This effect was a function of earthworm biomass, a surrogate for earthworm activity. We expect deer herbivory to increase in importance, including indirect effects, as seedlings grow into browse height over the next years.

A microcosm study was conducted to test the effects of the anecic earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris L, on the number of days for germination, % seed germination, seedling survival and seedling biomass of 14 tree species native to southern Quebec (Canada). Seeds of these species were germinated and grown in the presence or absence of L terrestris. The presence of earthworms significantly reduced % seed germination of seven tree species, as well as seedling survival of three tree species. The germination date of three tree species was significantly affected, either positively or negatively, by the presence of earthworms. Earthworms had no effect on seedling biomass.

"The action of an animal ecosystem engineer: identification of the main mechanisms of earthworm impacts on soil microarthropods.","Nico Eisenhauer","Nico Eisenhauer","Non-trophic interactions are shaping soil food web structure and functions. Particularly, the action of ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, are likely to fundamentally impact the abiotic and biotic properties of their environment. The present study aimed to identify the main mechanisms through which earthworms belonging to varying ecological groups - epigeic, endogeic and anecic species - affect soil microarthropods by reviewing the literature on this topic and by performing meta-analyses.  Earthworm ecological groups differed considerably in their impacts on microarthropods, whereas effects did not vary significantly between microarthropod taxa at the habitat scale. Inconsistent impacts of epigeic species on soil microarthropods are most likely due to differences in earthworm densities. Effects can thus be positive in the case of moderate densities or negative in the case of high densities and associated distinct changes in the physical structure of the upper soil organic layers. By contrast, impacts of endogeic earthworms appeared to be mainly negative and were primarily due to competition with microarthropods for food resources. Consequently, negative impacts on soil microarthropods intensified with increasing earthworm density and biomass. This interaction between endogeic earthworms and microarthropods is better referred to as amensalism due to the competitive predominance of earthworms. Impacts of anecic earthworm species differed significantly from that of endogeic ones; they were neutral at the habitat scale and positive on the microhabitat scale. Moreover, impacts were independent of earthworm densities due to the quasi-territorial behaviour of anecic earthworms. Positive effects were mainly attributed to the formation of stable microhabitats by anecic species; namely burrows/middens, rich in nutrients and microorganisms.  The present study points to the relevance of the non-trophic biotic interactions that drive the composition of belowground food webs by identifying the most essential mechanisms underlying the impacts of animal ecosystem engineers on soil microarthropods. Moreover, as earthworms emerge as important biological invaders, the results of the present study may help to fully appreciate, estimate and model the consequences of this momentous global change phenomenon. Particularly, the spread of exotic epigeic and endogeic earthworm species likely threatens soil microarthropod density, diversity and functions.

"Invasibility of experimental grassland communities: the role of earthworms, plant functional group identity and seed size.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Invasions of natural communities by non‐indigenous species threaten native biodiversity and are currently rated as one of the most important global‐scale environmental problems. The mechanisms that make communities resistant to invasions and drive the establishment success of seedlings are essential both for management and for understanding community assembly and structure. Especially in grasslands, anecic earthworms are known to function as ecosystem engineers, however, their direct effects on plant community composition and on the invasibility of plant communities via plant seed burial, ingestion and digestion are poorly understood.In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the impact ofLumbricus terrestris, plant functional group identity and seed size of plant invader species and plant functional group of the established plant community on the number and biomass of plant invaders. We set up 120 microcosms comprising four plant community treatments, two earthworm treatments and three plant invader treatments containing three seed size classes.Earthworm performance was influenced by an interaction between plant functional group identity of the established plant community and that of invader species. The established plant community and invader seed size affected the number of invader plants significantly, while invader biomass was only affected by the established community. Since earthworm effects on the number and biomass of invader plants varied with seed size and plant functional group identity they probably play a key role in seedling establishment and plant community composition.Seeds and germinating seedlings in earthworm burrows may significantly contribute to earthworm nutrition, but this deserves further attention.Lumbricus terrestrislikely behaves like a ‘farmer’ by collecting plant seeds which cannot directly be swallowed or digested. Presumably, these seeds are left in middens and become eatable after partial microbial decay. Increased earthworm numbers in more diverse plant communities likely contribute to the positive relationship between plant species diversity and resistance against invaders.","OIKOS ","en",2008,"Jul","Germany","Germany","10.1111/j030-1299.2008.16812.x","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40235493","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A ","N/A ","Keywords +: SPECIES-RICHNESS;DIVERSITY;INVASION;GROWTH;ECOLOGY;ESTABLISHMENT;LUMBRICIDAE;DISTURBANCE;HERBIVORY;PATTERNS","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasion of a deciduous forest by earthworms: changes in soil chemistry, microflora, microarthropods and vegetation.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Ecosystems of northern North America existed without earthworm fauna until European settlers arrived and introduced European species. The current extent of invasion by some of these species, Lumbricus terrestris L., Octolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (-75% and -22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.

"Direct and indirect effects of endogeic earthworms on plant seeds.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","The soil seed bank functions to escape unfavourable environmental conditions and seed predation. Anecic earthworms are increasingly recognised as important dispersers and predators of plant seeds. In contrast, the rote of the usually more abundant endogeic earthworms which live and feed in the soil on plant seeds is largely unknown. We tested whether (A) endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea rosea, Allolobophora chlorotica, Octolasion tyrtaeum, Aporrectodea caliginosa) ingest and digest grassland plant seeds (Phleum pratense, Bellis perennis, Trifolium repens, Poa trivialis, Plantago lanceolato, Medicago varia), (B) the passage of seeds through the gut of endogeic earthworms modifies seed germination, and (C) excreta (mucus and casts) of endogeic earthworms modify seed germination. As a reference effects of the well-studied anecic species Lumbricus terrestris were determined. Endogeic earthworms ingested and digested all of the studied plant seeds; however, both ingestion and digestion were earthworm and plant species specific. Moreover, passage through the gut of endogeic earthworms and their excreta modified plant seed germination (gut passage: B. perennis; excreta: Ph. pratense and Pl. lanceolato). The results indicate that endogeic earthworms may strongly impact the composition of the soil seed bank and, consequently, plant community assembly via direct and indirect effects on plant seeds. Since post-dispersal seed predation is a key factor for the structure of plant communities, with the effect on seed survival potentially exceeding that of pre-dispersal predation, seed predation and changes in germination of seeds by endogeic earthworm species is likely to drive plant community composition.","PEDOBIOLOGIA ","en",2009,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.pedobi.2008702","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.07.002","10.1111/gcb.13446","Germany","grassland field site of The Jena Experiment (Near the Saale river within the city boundaries of Jena in Thuringia)","Above and belowground interactions;Earthworm casts;Earthworm mucus;Grassland;Seed bank;The Jena Experiment","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworms as seedling predators: Importance of seeds and seedlings for earthworm nutrition.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Anecic earthworms have been shown to collect, concentrate and bury seeds in their burrows. Moreover, recent studies suggest that earthworms function as granivores and seedling herbivores thereby directly impacting plant community assembly. However, this has not been proven unequivocally. Further, it remains unclear if earthworms benefit from seed ingestion, i.e., if they assimilate seed carbon. We set up a series of three laboratory experiments in order to test the following hypotheses: (1) anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L) not only ingest seeds but also seedlings, (2) ingestion of seedlings is lower than that of seeds due to a 'size refuge' of seedlings (i.e., they are too big to be swallowed), and (3) seeds and seedlings contribute to earthworm nutrition. L terrestris readily consumed legume seedlings in the radicle stage, whereas legume seeds and seedlings in the cotyledon stage, and grass seeds and seedlings in the radicle and cotyledon stage were ingested in similar but lower amounts. Importantly, ingestion of seedlings, in contrast to seeds, was lethal for all plant species. Moreover, earthworm weight change varied with the functional identity and vitality of seeds and natural N-15 signatures in earthworm body tissue underlined the importance of seedlings for earthworm nutrition. The results indicate that the anecic earthworm L. terrestris indeed functions as a granivore and seedling herbivore. The selectivity in seedling ingestion points at the potential of direct earthworm effects on plant community assembly. Further, seeds and seedlings most likely contribute significantly to earthworm nutrition potentially explaining the collection and concentration of seeds by L terrestris in its middens and burrows; however, the present results call for experiments under more natural conditions.

"Interactive effects of global warming and “global worming” on the initial establishment of native and exotic herbaceous plant species.","Nico Eisenhauer","Peter B. Reich","The spread of exotic earthworms (‘worming’) and rising temperatures are expected to alter the biological, chemical and physical properties of many ecosystems, yet little is known about their potential interactive effects. We performed a laboratory microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of earthworms (anecic, endogeic, epigeic, or all three together) and 4°C warming on soil water content, litter turnover and seedling establishment of four native and four exotic herbaceous plant species.Warming and worming exerted independent as well as interactive effects on soil processes and plant dynamics. Warming reduced the water content of the upper soil layer, but only in the presence of earthworms. Litter removal increased in the presence of earthworms, the effect being most pronounced in the presence of anecic earthworms at ambient temperature. Exotic plant species were most influenced by earthworms (lower seedling number but higher biomass), whereas natives were most sensitive to warming (higher seedling number). This differential response resulted in significant interaction effects of earthworms and warming on abundance and richness of native relative to exotic plants as well as related shifts in plant species composition. Structural equation modeling allowed us to address possible mechanisms: direct effects of earthworms primarily affected exotic plants, whereas earthworms and warming indirectly and differentially affected native and exotic plants through changes in soil water content and surface litter.Invasive earthworms and warming are likely to interactively impact abiotic and biotic ecosystem properties. The invasion of epigeic and anecic species could select for plant species able to germinate on bare soil and tolerate drought, with the latter becoming more important in a warmer world. Thus earthworm invasion may result in simplified plant communities of increased susceptibility to the invasion of exotic plants.","Oikos","en",2011,"Nov","Germany","Australia","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19807.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19807.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Cloquet Forestry Center","Keywords + : EUROPEAN EARTHWORM INVASION;NORTHERN HARDWOOD FORESTS;SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT;ENDOGEIC EARTHWORMS;ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;TEMPERATE;IMPACT;DECOMPOSITION;INVASIBILITY ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

The main criticism is that the previous focus of BEF experiments on random species assemblages within each level of diversity has ‘limited the understanding of how natural communities respond to biodiversity loss.’ He concludes that a broader spectrum of approaches considering both non‐random gains and losses of diversity is essential to advance this field of research. Wardle's paper is timely because of recent observations of frequent local and regional biodiversity changes across ecosystems. While we appreciate that new and complementary experimental approaches are required for advancing the field, we question criticisms regarding the validity of BEF experiments. Therefore, we respond by briefly reiterating previous arguments emphasizing the reasoning behind random species composition in BEF experiments. We describe how BEF experiments have identified important mechanisms that play a role in real world ecosystems, advancing our understanding of ecosystem responses to species gains and losses. We discuss recent examples where theory derived from BEF experiments enriched our understanding of the consequences of biodiversity changes in real world ecosystems and where comprehensive analyses and integrative modelling approaches confirmed patterns found in BEF experiments.

"Earthworms reduce biotic 15-Nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Holly A. Ewing","Esteban Suarez","Invasive exotic earthworms are significantly influencing understory community composition, soil, and ecosystem processes in northern hardwood forests in North America, but their effect on the retention of nitrogen (N) has been inconclusive. We examined this in two northern hardwood forest sites in New York state, USA through a tracer study. In both spring and fall, we added tracer amounts of N-15 as nitrate-to simulate atmospheric deposition-with the biologically less active tracer bromide (Br-) to areas both with and without large populations of invasive earthworms. Total recovery of N-15 was lower in earthworm-invaded plots, largely due to less retention in litter and upper soil horizons. Although the strong relationship between retention in the upper soil horizons and total N-15 recovery suggests that earthworm destruction of the forest floor may be one mechanism reducing the capacity for N retention, in some cases the mineral soil in earthworm-invaded plots retained substantial N. Biotic pools, particularly litter and microbial biomass, retained significantly less N-15 in earthworm-invaded plots than in their uninvaded counterparts. In plots invaded by earthworms, negative effects of earthworms on trees were revealed through root-uptake assays suggesting somewhat greater plant demand for ammonium in the spring and in lower N-15 recovery in maple seedlings the year following tracer addition. Although similar patterns of Br- movement across treatments suggested that earthworms had smaller effects on hydrologic tracer movement than expected, they appear to have significant effects on the biological processes that underlie N retention.","ECOSYSTEMS ","en",2015,"Mar","USA","Ecuador","10.1007/s10021-014-9831-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9831-z","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","ammonium;earthworms;hardwood forest;hydrology;invasive species;nitrate;nitrogen retention;nutrient cycling;microbes;soils","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm effects on the incorporation of litter C and N into soil organic matter in a sugar maple forest.","Timothy J. Fahey","Patrick J. Bohlen","To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double‐labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22% ± 5.4% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm‐invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.","Ecological Applications","en",2013,"Jul ","USA","USA","10.1890/12-1760.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1760.1","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Cornell University's Arnot Forest located in Tompkins County, central New York State","aggregate;C:N ratio;decomposition;litter;Lumbricus;stoichiometry","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Carbon food resources of earthworms of different ecological groups as indicated by 13C compound-specific stable isotope analysis.","Olga Ferlian","Stefan Scheu","One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific C-13 stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed C-13 signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA delta C-13 profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with delta C-13 signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.

"Linking direct and indirect pathways mediating earthworms, deer, and understory composition in Great Lakes forests.","Nicholas A. Fisichelli","Nico Eisenhauer","Ahistorical drivers such as nonnative invasive earthworms and high deer densities can have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes and plant community composition in temperate and boreal forests of North America. To assess the roles of earthworm disturbance, deer, and environmental factors in the understory, we sampled 125 mixed temperate-boreal forest sites across the western Great Lakes region. We utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to address the hypothesis that earthworm disturbance to the upper soil horizons and selective herbivory by deer are associated with depauperate understory plant communities dominated by graminoid and nonnative species. Evidence of earthworm activity was found at 93 % of our sites and 49 % had high to very high severity earthworm disturbance. The SEM fit the data well and indicated that widespread nonnative earthworm disturbance and high deer densities had similar magnitudes of impact on understory plant communities and that these impacts were partially mediated by environmental characteristics. One-third of the variation in earthworm disturbance was explained by soil pH, precipitation, and litter quality. Deer density and earthworm disturbance both increased graminoid cover while environmental variables showed direct and indirect relationships. For example, the positive relationship between temperature and graminoids was indirect through a positive temperature effect on deer density. This research characterizes an integrated set of key environmental variables driving earthworm disturbance and deer impacts on the forest understory, facilitating predictions of the locations and severity of future change in northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2012,"Dec","USA","Germany","10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","125 forest sites in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan","Carex pensylvanica;Climate;Deer browsing;Earthworm invasion;Forest soils;Graminoid cover;Invasive plants;Understory plant community","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Importance of earthworm–seed interactions for the composition and structure of plant communities: A review.","Estelle Forey","Nico Eisenhauer","Soil seed bank composition and dynamics are crucial elements for the understanding of plant population and community ecology. Earthworms are increasingly recognized as important dispersers and predators of seeds. Through direct and indirect effects they influence either positively or negatively the establishment and survival of seeds and seedlings.  Seedling establishment is affected by a variety of earthworm-mediated mechanisms, such as selective seed ingestion and digestion, acceleration or deceleration of germination, and seed transport. Earthworm casts deposited on the soil surface and the entrance of earthworm burrows often contain viable seeds and constitute important regeneration niches for plant seedlings and therefore likely favour specific seed traits. However, the role of earthworms as seed dispersers, mediators of seed bank dynamics and seed predators has not been considered in concert. The overall effect of earthworms on plant communities remains little understood. Most knowledge is based on laboratory studies on temperate species and future work has to explore the biological significance of earthworm-seed interactions under more natural conditions.  In this review we summarize the current knowledge on earthworm-seed interactions and discuss factors determining these interactions. We highlight that this interaction may be an underappreciated, yet major driving force for the dynamics of soil seed banks and plant communities which most likely have experienced co-evolutionary processes. Despite the experimental bias, we hypothesize that the knowledge gathered in the present review is of crucial relevance for restoration and conservation ecology. For instance, as earthworms emerge as successful and ubiquitous invaders in various ecosystems, the summarized information might serve as a basis for realistic estimations and modelling of consequences on native plant communities. We depict promising directions of future research and point to the need to consider above- and belowground interactions in order to mechanistically understand the driving forces of plant community assembly.

"Earthworm invasion into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests.","Lee E. Frelich","Reich, Peter B.","Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can influence primary producers by changing seedbed conditions, soil characteristics, flow of water, nutrients and carbon, and plant-herbivore interactions. The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2006,"Sep","USA","Australia","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","New York forests, Minnesota forests","Aporrectodea;Dendrobaena;Exotic earthworm invasion;Lumbricus rubellus;Lumbricus terrestris;Keystone species;Minnesota forests;New York forests","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Trophic cascades, invasive species and body-size hierarchies interactively modulate climate change responses of ecotonal temperate–boreal forest.","Lee E. Frelich","Nico Eisenhauer","As the climate warms, boreal tree species are expected to be gradually replaced by temperate species within the southern boreal forest. Warming will be accompanied by changes in above- and below-ground consumers: large moose (Alces alces) replaced by smaller deer (Odocoileus virginianus) above-ground, and small detritivores replaced by larger exotic earthworms below-ground. These shifts may induce a cascade of ecological impacts across trophic levels that could alter the boreal to temperate forest transition. Deer are more likely to browse saplings of temperate tree species, and European earthworms favour seedlings of boreal tree species more than temperate species, potentially hindering the ability of temperate tree species to expand northwards. We hypothesize that warming-induced changes in consumers will lead to novel plant communities by changing the filter on plant species success, and that above- and below-ground cascades of trophic interactions will allow boreal tree species to persist during early phases of warming, leading to an abrupt change at a later time. The synthesis of evidence suggests that consumers can modify the climate change-induced transition of ecosystems.","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2012,"Nov","USA","USA","10.1098/rstb.2012235","https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0235","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","body mass;climate warming;exotic earthworms;trophic interactions;soil food webs","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Exploring carbon flow through the root channel in a temperate forest soil food web.","Kadeem J. Gilbert","Joseph B.

We traced a pulse of C-13 from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs. Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to global changes that alter proportional tree C allocation belowground.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",2014,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.soilbio.2014505","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.05.005","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Arnot Forest, central New York","Ants;Carbon;Earthworms;Energy flow;Invasive species;Salamander","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Estimating local biodiversity change: a critique of papers claiming no net loss of local diversity.","Gonzalez, Andrew","Loreau, Michel","Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.","ECOLOGY ","en",2016,"Aug","Canada","France","10.3410/f.726357299.793518743","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.726357299.793518743","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Anthropocene;baselines;biodiversity monitoring;extinction;invasion;meta-analysis;species richness;time series","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworms increase soil microbial biomass carrying capacity and nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Peter M. Groffman","John C. Maerz","Earthworms have been shown to produce contrasting effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics. We measured soil C and N pools and processes and traced the flow of C-13 and N-15 from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter into soil microbial biomass and respirable C and mineralizable and inorganic N pools in mature northern hardwood forest plots with variable earthworm communities. Previous studies have shown that plots dominated by either Lumbricus rubellus or Lumbricus terrestris have markedly lower total soil C than uncolonized plots. Here we show that total soil N pools in earthworm colonized plots were reduced much less than C, but significantly so in plots dominated by contain L rubellus. Pools of microbial biomass C and N were higher in earthworm-colonized (especially those dominated by L rubellus) plots and more C-13 and N-15 were recovered in microbial biomass and less was recovered in mineralizable and inorganic N pools in these plots. These plots also had lower rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification than uncolonized reference plots. These results suggest that earthworm stimulation of microbial biomass and activity underlie depletion of soil C and retention and maintenance of soil N pools, at least in northern hardwood forests. Earthworms increase the carrying capacity of soil for microbial biomass and facilitate the flow of N from litter into stable soil organic matter. However, declines in soil C and C:N ratio may increase the potential for hydrologic and gaseous losses in earthworm-colonized sites under changing environmental conditions.

Ash-free dry mass is the best standardized measure of earthworm biomass, but requires the destruction of specimens.

"Effects of European earthworm invasion on soil characteristics in northern hardwood forests of Minnesota.","Cindy M. Hale","John Pastor","European earthworms are colonizing worm-free hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it's percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists.

"Changes in hardwood forest understory plant communities in response to European earthworm invasions.","Cindy M. Hale","Peter B. Reich","European earthworms are colonizing earthworm-free northern hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion provide an opportunity to investigate the response of understory plant communities to earthworm invasion and whether the species composition of the earthworm community influences that response. Four sugar maple-dominated forest sites with active earthworm invasions were identified in the Chippewa National Forest in north central Minnesota, USA. In each site, we established a 30 X 150 m sample grid that spanned a visible leading edge of earthworm invasion and sampled earthworm populations and understory vegetation over four years. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with decreasing diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants in two of four study sites, and the abundance and density of tree seedlings decreased in three of four study sites. Sample points with the most diverse earthworm species assemblage, independent of biomass, had the lowest plant diversity. Changes in understory plant community composition were most affected by increasing biomass of the earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus. Where L. rubellus was absent there was a diverse community of native herbaceous plants, but where L. rubellus biomass reached its maximum, the herbaceous-plant community was dominated by Carex pensylvanica and Arisaema triphyllum and, in some cases, was completely absent. Evidence from these forest sites suggests that earthworm invasion can lead to dramatic changes in the understory community and that the nature of these changes is influenced by the species composition of the invading earthworm community.","ECOLOGY ","en",2006,"Jul","USA","Australia","10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1637:cihfup]2.co;2","https://www.jstor.org/stable/20069122","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chippewa National Forest of northern Minnesota","Acer saccharum;earthworm invasion;ecosystem change;exotic species invasion;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;tree seedlings;understory plant communities","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Hale","Susan Kalisz","Invasive plants impose novel selection pressures on naïve mutualistic interactions between native plants and their partners. As most plants critically rely on root fungal symbionts (RFSs) for soil resources, invaders that disrupt plant–RFS mutualisms can significantly depress native plant fitness. Here, we investigate the consequences of RFS mutualism disruption on native plant fitness in a glasshouse experiment with a forest invader that produces known anti‐fungal allelochemicals.Over 5 months, we regularly applied either green leaves of the allelopathic invader Alliaria petiolata, a nonsystemic fungicide to simulate A. petiolata's effects, or green leaves of nonallelopathic Hesperis matronalis (control) to pots containing the native Maianthemum racemosum and its RFSs. We repeatedly measured M. racemosum physiology and harvested plants periodically to assess carbon allocation.Alliaria petiolata and fungicide treatment effects were indistinguishable: we observed inhibition of the RFS soil hyphal network and significant reductions in M. racemosum physiology (photosynthesis, transpiration and conductance) and allocation (carbon storage, root biomass and asexual reproduction) in both treatments relative to the control.Our findings suggest a general mechanistic hypothesis for local extinction of native species in ecosystems challenged by allelopathic invaders: RFS mutualism disruption drives carbon stress, subsequent declines in native plant vigor, and, if chronic, declines in RFS‐dependent species abundance.","NEW PHYTOLOGIST ","en",2016,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1111/nph.13709","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.13709","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A ","N/A","allelopathy;Alliaria petiolata;carbon allocation;invasion;mutualism disruption;physiology;root fungal symbionts","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Exotic earthworm invasions in North America: ecological and policy implications: expanding global commerce may be increasing thelikelihood of exotic earthworm invasions, which could have negative implications for soil processes, other animal and plant species, and importation of certain pathogens.","PAUL F. HENDRIX","PATRICK J. BOHLEN","Earthworms are the best known and, in many situations, the most important animals that live in soil. Over 3500 earthworm species have been described worldwide, and it is estimated that further surveys will reveal this number to be much larger (Reynolds 1994, Fragoso et al. 1999). Distinct taxonomic groups of earthworms have arisen on every continent except Antarctica, and, through human transport, some groups have been distributed worldwide (Jamieson 1988, Reynolds 1994). The earthworm fauna of North America, including Canada, the continental United States, Mexico, and the islands of the Caribbean, consists of both native (Nearctic and Neotropical) and exotic species imported from many other regions of the world (Fender 1995, Fragoso et al. 1995, James 1995, Reynolds 1995). Any given locality may be inhabited by all native species, all exotic species, a combination of native and exotic species, or by no earthworms at all. Relative abundance and species composition of local fauna depend greatly on soil, climate, vegetation, topography, land use history, and especially on past invasions by exotic species.  Much of our knowledge of the earthworm fauna of North America is based on the work of Gordon E. Gates who, over a 60-year career, collected, described, and cataloged many of the currently recognized taxa, both native and exotic. Beginning in 1949, Gates collaborated with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Bureau of Plant Quarantine (now Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS) to intercept oligochaetes found in “plant-associated materials” (mostly soil) being imported into the United States. Over a 32-year period (1950–1982), Gates (1976, 1982) acquired thousands of specimens and was able to determine that earthworms from all over the world were continually being imported. There is no reason to expect that this situation has changed since 1982. Indeed, as with exotic plants, fungi, and insects (Ruesink et al. 1995, Campbell 2001, Mack and Lonsdale 2001), growing global commerce may be increasing the likelihood that exotic earthworms will be introduced, both inadvertently with the importation of soil-containing materials (e.g., agricultural and horticultural products; Gates 1976, 1982, Boag and Yeates 2001, Ehrenfeld and Scott 2001) and intentionally for use in commercial applications (e.g., waste management and land bioremediation; Lee 1995, Edwards 1998). Because previous invasions by exotic earthworms have had significant impacts on soil processes and plant communities in native ecosystems (e.g., Alban and Berry 1994, Groffman and Bohlen 1999, Hale et al. 2000), there may be reason for concern over continued unrestricted importation of earthworms.  Regulatory activities have not been effective in reducing earthworm introductions in most areas of the world (Boag and Yeates 2001), probably because legal restrictions traditionally have not targeted earthworms or their propagules. There presently are no specific regulations concerning earthworm imports into the United States. Earthworm importations are regulated by APHIS under the Federal Plant Pest Act because of the potential for introduction of exotic plant pathogens in their guts and in soil that might accompany them (Tracy A. Horner, USDA APHIS, personal communication, 3 January 2002). The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe has heightened concern about earthworm imports, because some species may be vectors for that viral pathogen and others (Edwards and Bohlen 1996, Jamieson 2000). APHIS is now considering guidelines specifically for the importation of earthworms into the United States. In this article, which is derived from a report prepared recently for APHIS, we review the status of earthworms in North America, address problems associated with exotic earthworm invasions, and discuss criteria for assessing potential risks of earthworm importation.","BioScience","en",2002,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:eeiina]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:EEIINA]2.0.CO;2","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","North America ","N/A ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Interactions of an introduced shrub and introduced earthworms in an Illinois urban woodland: impact on leaf litter decomposition.","Liam Heneghan","Kristen Fagen","This study examined an 'invasional meltdown' where the invasion of a Midwestern, woodland by an exotic shrub (Rhamnus cathartica L.P. Mill) and the invasion by Eurasian earthworms facilitated one another. Using a litterbag approach, we examined mass loss of four substrates (R. cathartica, Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba) along a gradient of Eurasian earthworm density and biomass throughout a 40.5 ha oak woodland in Glencoe, Illinois. Earthworm densities and biomass were greatest in patches where R. cathartica prevailed, and populations were lowest in an upland forest subcommunity within the woodland. At each of three points along this earthworm gradient, we placed replicated litterbags constructed either to permit or to deny access to the titter by earthworms. The treatments were, therefore, plot treatments (tow, medium and high earthworm density and biomass) and litterbag treatments (earthworm access and earthworm excluded). We found that earthworms promoted a very rapid loss of litter from R. cathartica bags. Within 3 months greater than 90% of this litter was Lost from the litterbags. Earthworm impacts on other substrates followed the sequence A. saccharum > Q. alba = Q. rubra. Effects of both litterbag and plot treatments were found within 3 months for A. saccharum but Quercus species were affected only after a year. We propose that the impact of earthworms on litter breakdown creates conditions that promote and sustain invasion by R. cathartica. Previous work has demonstrated that R. cathortica may alter soil properties in a way that promotes and sustains invasion by earthworms. These findings have implications for the restoration management of these systems, since the legacy of R. cathartica on soil properties and earthworm populations may persist even after the plant has been physically removed.

"Effects of earthworm invasion on plant species richness in northern hardwood forests.","ANDREW R. HOLDSWORTH","PETER B. REICH",": The invasion of non‐native earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) into a small number of intensively studied stands of northern hardwood forest has been linked to declines in plant diversity and the local extirpation of one threatened species. It is unknown, however, whether these changes have occurred across larger regions of hardwood forests, which plant species are most vulnerable, or with which earthworm species such changes are associated most closely. To address these issues we conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon national forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin (U.S.A.), respectively. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation, examined deer browse in 20 mature, sugar‐maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest, and analyzed the relationship between invasive earthworms and vascular plant species richness and composition. Invasion by Lumbricus was a strong indicator of reduced plant richness in both national forests. The mass of Lumbricus juveniles was significantly and negatively related to plant‐species richness in both forests. In addition, Lumbricus was a significant factor affecting plant richness in a full model that included multiple variables. In the Chequamegon National Forest earthworm mass was associated with higher sedge cover and lower cover of sugar maple seedlings and several forb species. The trends were similar but not as pronounced in Chippewa, perhaps due to lower deer densities and different earthworm species composition. Our results provide regional evidence that invasion by Lumbricus species may be an important mechanism in reduced plant‐species richness and changes in plant communities in mature forests dominated by sugar maples.","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY ","en",2007,"Aug","USA","Australia","10.1111/j.1523-1739.20070740.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00740.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chequamegon National Forest in Wisconsin (46°N, 91°W) and the Chippewa National Forest in Minnesota (47°N, 94°W)","deer herbivory;earthworm invasion;herbaceous layer;invasive species;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;plant-species richness;regional survey ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Regional extent of an ecosystem engineer: Earthworm invasion in northern hardwood forests.","Andrew R. Holdsworth","Peter B. Reich","The invasion of exotic earthworms into northern temperate and boreal forests previously devoid of earthworms is an important driver of ecosystem change. Earthworm invasion can cause significant changes in soil structure and communities, nutrient cycles, and the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants. However, the regional extent and patterns of this invasion are poorly known. We conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon National Forests, in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to measure the extent and patterns of earthworm invasion and their relationship to potential earthworm introduction sites. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation in 20 mature, sugar maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest and analyzed the relationship between the presence of five earthworm taxonomic groups, habitat variables, and distance to the nearest potential introduction site. Earthworm invasion was extensive but incomplete in the two national forests. Four of the six earthworm taxonomic groups occurred in 55–95% of transects; however 20% of all transects were invaded by only one taxonomic group that has relatively minor ecological effects. Earthworm taxonomic groups exhibited a similar sequence of invasion found in other studies:Dendrobaena&gt;Aporrectodea=Lumbricusjuveniles &gt;L. rubellus&gt;L. terrestris.Distance to the nearest road was the best predictor of earthworm invasion in Wisconsin while distance to the nearest cabin was the best predictor in Minnesota. These data allow us to make preliminary assessments of landscape patterns of earthworm invasion. As an example, we estimate that 82% of upland mesic hardwood stands in the Wisconsin region are likely invaded by most taxonomic groups while only 3% are unlikely to be invaded at present. Distance to roads and cabins provides a coarse‐scale predictor of earthworm invasion to focus stand‐level assessments that will help forest managers better understand current and potential forest conditions and identify uninvaded areas that could serve as important refugia for plant species threatened by earthworm invasion.","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS ","en",2007,"Sep","USA","Australia","10.1890/05-2003.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-2003.1","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chippewa and Chequamegon National Forests, in Minnesota and Wisconsin","Acer saccharum;earthworm invasion;ecosystem change;exotic species invasion extent;forest floor;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;regional survey;roadless areas ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Uses and misuses of meta-analysis in plant ecology.","Julia Koricheva","Jessica Gurevitch","The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","en",2014,"Jul ","UK","USA","10.1111/1365-2745.12224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12224","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","ecophysiology;meta-analysis;methodological quality;plant ecology;research synthesis;systematic review;vote counting ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

However, long-term studies on the effects of invasive earthworms are limited because little data exist on the timing and rate of earthworm invasion at specific sites. We successfully used tree rings to identify the timing of earthworm invasions and the effects of earthworm activity on the Acer saccharum overstory of two recently invaded sites in northern Minnesota, thereby establishing a method to date earthworm invasions at other sites. In addition to identifying a tree-ring signature related to earthworm invasion, we found trees growing in invaded conditions were more sensitive to drought than trees growing in earthworm-free conditions. Increased drought sensitivity by A. saccharum has important implications for possible range shifts under climate change scenarios that include increasing drought frequency and severity.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2010,"May","USA","Australia","10.1007/s10530-009-9523-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9523-3","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Northern Minnesota","Acer saccharum;Climate-tree growth relationship;Dendroecology;Earthworm invasion;European earthworms;Northern Minnesota ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Quantification of invasions is necessary for understanding impacts and identifying remnant earthworm-free areas, but existing sampling techniques are effort-intensive and/or environmentally damaging. We: (1) developed and applied a protocol that allows rapid classification of earthworm invasion into five stages based primarily on visual assessment of the forest floor, (2) sampled earthworms to test whether the protocol's stages can predict invasion by different species, and (3) assessed relationships between individual forest floor characteristics and presence of different earthworm species. Based on differences in biomass among points assigned to different stages, the 5-stage classification protocol accurately identified the onset of invasion by Lumbricus rubellus and Lumbricus terrestris, the species of greatest management concern in the northern Midwest. Except for middens as a predictor of L. terrestris presence, no forest floor variable was useful by itself for assessing invasions.

"The influence of invasive earthworms on indigenous fauna in ecosystems previously uninhabited by earthworms.","Sonja Migge-Kleian","Liam Heneghan","Recent studies on earthworm invasion of North American soils report dramatic changes in soil structure, nutrient dynamics and plant communities in ecosystems historically free of earthworms. However, the direct and indirect impacts of earthworm invasions on animals have been largely ignored. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of earthworm invasion on other soil fauna, vertebrates as well as invertebrates.  Earthworm invasions can have positive effects on the abundance of other soil invertebrates, but such effects are often small, transient, and restricted to habitats with harsh climates or a long history of earthworm co-occurrence with other soil invertebrates. Middens and burrows can increase soil heterogeneity and create microhabitats with a larger pore size, high microbial biomass, and microclimates that are attractive to micro- and mesofauna. Under harsh climatic conditions, the aggregates formed by earthworms may increase the stability of soil microclimates. Positive effects can also be seen when comminution and mucus secretion increase the palatability of unpalatable organic material for microorganisms which are the main food of most micro- and mesofaunal groups. For larger invertebrates or small vertebrates, invasive earthworms may become important prey, with the potential to increase resource availability.  In the longer-term, the activity of invading earthworms can have a strong negative impact on indigenous faunal groups across multiple trophic levels. Evidence from field and laboratory studies indicates that the restructuring of soil layers, particularly the loss of organic horizons, physical disturbance to the soil, alteration of understory vegetation, and direct competition for food resources, lead directly and indirectly to significant declines in the abundance of soil micro- and mesofauna. Though studies of invasive earthworm impacts on the abundance of larger invertebrates or vertebrates are generally lacking, recent evidence suggests that reduced abundance of small soil fauna and alteration of soil microclimates may be contributing to declines in vertebrate fauna such as terrestrial salamanders. Preliminary evidence also suggests the potential for earthworm invasions to interact with other factors such as soil pollution, to negatively affect vertebrate populations.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","en",2006,"Sep","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","western Canada, mid-western USA, north-eastern USA","biological invasion;Collembola disturbance;earthworm invasion;Oribatida review;soil fauna;Salamander ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasions: the trail behind, the path ahead, and a test of a disturbing idea.","Angela T. Moles","Fiona J. Thomson","1. We provide a brief overview of progress in our understanding of introduced plant species.2. Three main conclusions emerge from our review: (i) Many lines of research, including the search for traits that make species good invaders, or that make ecosystems susceptible to invasion, are yielding idiosyncratic results. To move forward, we advocate a more synthetic approach that incorporates a range of different types of information about the introduced species and the communities and habitats they are invading. (ii) Given the growing evidence for the adaptive capacity of both introduced species and recipient communities, we need to consider the implications of the long‐term presence of introduced species in our ecosystems. (iii) Several foundational ideas in invasion biology have become widely accepted without appropriate testing, or despite equivocal evidence from empirical tests. One such idea is the suggestion that disturbance facilitates invasion.3. We use data from 200 sites around the world to provide a broad test of the hypothesis that invasions are better predicted by a change in disturbance regime than by disturbance per se. Neither disturbance nor change in disturbance regime explained more than 7% of the variation in the % of cover or species richness contributed by introduced species. However, change in disturbance regime was a significantly better predictor than was disturbance per se, explaining approximately twice as much variation as did disturbance.4. Synthesis. Disturbance is a weak predictor of invasion. To increase predictive power, we need to consider multiple variables (both intrinsic and extrinsic to the site) simultaneously.

Romanuk","There is high uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of current and future biodiversity loss that is occurring due to human disturbances. Here, we present a global meta‐analysis of experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average, human‐mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3% decline in species richness. Declines in species richness were highest for endotherms (33.2%), followed by producers (25.1%), and ectotherms (10.5%). Land‐use change and species invasions had the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8% and 23.7% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14%), nutrient addition (8.2%), and increases in temperature (3.6%). Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4%) than aquatic biomes (5.9%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land‐use change had the largest impact on species richness, whereas in the boreal forest and Northern temperate forests, species invasions had the largest impact on species richness. Along with revealing trends in changes in species richness for different disturbances, biomes, and taxa, our results also identify critical knowledge gaps for predicting the effects of human disturbance on Earth's biomes.","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION ","en",2014,"Jan","Canada","Canada","10.1002/ece3.909","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.909","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various","Various","Biodiversity loss;disturbance;extinction;habitat loss;species invasions;species richness ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Methodological issues and advances in biological meta-analysis.","Nakagawa S.","Santos E. S. A.","Meta-analysis has changed the way researchers conduct literature reviews not only in medical and social sciences but also in biological sciences. Meta-analysis in biological sciences, especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as 'biological' meta-analysis) faces somewhat different methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally developed. The main reason for such differences is that biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2) detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of across-study and within-study meta-analysis, and propose how the use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical studies typical of ecology and evolution.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",2012,"Sep","Australia","Brazil ","10.4324/9781410606747-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781410606747-9","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various","Various","Fixed-effect meta-analysis;Random-effects meta-analysis;Meta-regression;Egger's regression;I-2;Heterogeneity;Multivariate meta-analysis;Trim and fill method ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

By adopting a 'resistance-resilience' framework, important insights for conservation can be gained into: (i) the key role of resistance in response to persistent disturbance, (ii) the intrinsic attributes of an ecological unit associated with resistance and resilience, (iii) the extrinsic environmental factors that influence resistance and resilience, (iv) mechanisms that confer resistance and resilience, (v) the post-disturbance status of an ecological unit, (vi) the nature of long-term ecological changes, and (vii) policy-relevant ways of communicating the ecological impacts of disturbance processes.","TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION ","en",2015,"Sep","Australia","Australia","10.1016/j.tree.2015708","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.07.008","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various","Various","Keywords +: COMMUNITY ECOLOGY;BIOTIC RESISTANCE;WOODLAND BIRDS;RESILIENCE;STABILITY;DISTURBANCE;DIVERSITY;PLANT;BIODIVERSITY;RESPONSES ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm invasion as the driving force behind plant invasion and community change in northeastern North American forests.","VICTORIA A. NUZZO","BERND BLOSSEY","Identification of factors that drive changes in plant community structure and contribute to decline and endangerment of native plant species is essential to the development of appropriate management strategies. Introduced species are assumed to be driving causes of shifts in native plant communities, but unequivocal evidence supporting this view is frequently lacking. We measured native vegetation, non‐native earthworm biomass, and leaf‐litter volume in 15 forests in the presence and absence of 3 non‐native plant species (Microstegium vimineum, Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii) to assess the general impact of non‐native plant and earthworm invasions on native plant communities in northeastern United States. Non‐native plant cover was positively correlated with total native plant cover and non‐native earthworm biomass. Earthworm biomass was negatively associated with cover of native woody and most herbaceous plants and with litter volume. Graminoid cover was positively associated with non‐native earthworm biomass and non‐native plant cover. These earthworm‐associated responses were detected at all sites despite differences in earthworm species and abundance, composition of the native plant community, identity of invasive plant species, and geographic region. These patterns suggest earthworm invasion, rather than non‐native plant invasion, is the driving force behind changes in forest plant communities in northeastern North America, including declines in native plant species, and earthworm invasions appear to facilitate plant invasions in these forests. Thus, a focus on management of invasive plant species may be insufficient to protect northeastern forest understory species.","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY ","en",2009,"Aug","USA","USA","10.1111/j.1523-1739.20091168.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01168.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","northeastern forests","Alliaria petiolata;Berberis thunbergii;earthworm invasion;facilitation;forest soils;invasive plants;leaf litter;Microstegium vimineum ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive earthworms shape forest seed bank composition.","Victoria Nuzzo","Bernd Blossey","To assess how non‐native earthworm and non‐native plant invasions shape soil seed bank composition in deciduous temperate forests.LocationNew York State, USA.MethodsWe recorded earthworm density, earthworm biomass and vegetation composition in 12 deciduous forests and subsequently collected soil cores and recorded emergence of plant species from the seed bank. We used path analysis to assess direct and indirect contributions of earthworms and vegetation composition (species richness and cover of native and non‐native plants) to the species richness and abundance of emergent seedlings.ResultsHigh earthworm populations were positively associated with increased species richness and seedling density of both native and non‐native plant species emerging from the seed bank. This relationship held for all life‐form groups, although the earthworm effect was indirect for non‐native graminoid abundance. Non‐native plants were positively correlated with earthworms and while they influenced both aboveground vegetation cover and species richness, they had no direct influence on emergent abundance or species richness.Main conclusionsOur results suggest that forest seed bank composition is strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of non‐native earthworms, and only weakly influenced by non‐native plants. Forest understorey recovery from seed banks is possible following earthworm invasion, but resulting communities bear little similarity to standing vegetation. Recovery of the full desirable and typical complement of aboveground vegetation will require input to seed banks by (1) fostering seed production of existing vegetation and/or (2) planting seed of desired species. We suggest managing understorey vegetation to allow herbaceous species to set seed.","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS ","en",2015,"May","USA","USA","10.1111/ddi.12322","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12322","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","New York state","Alliaria petiolata;Berberis thunbergii;biological invasions;invasive plants;Microstegium vimineum;species richness ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Belowground interactions with aboveground consequences: Invasive earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","Shishir Paudel","Scott R. Loss","A mounting body of research suggests that invasive nonnative earthworms substantially alter microbial communities, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These changes to AMF can cascade to affect plant communities and vertebrate populations. Despite these research advances, relatively little is known about (1) the mechanisms behind earthworms' effects on AMF and (2) the factors that determine the outcomes of earthworm-AMF interactions (i.e., whether AMF abundance is increased or decreased and subsequent effects on plants). We predict that AMF-mediated effects of nonnative earthworms on ecosystems are nearly universal because (1) AMF are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems, (2) nonnative earthworms have become established in nearly every type of terrestrial ecosystem, and (3) nonnative earthworms, due to their burrowing and feeding behavior, greatly affect AMF with potentially profound concomitant effects on plant communities. We highlight the multiple direct and indirect effects of nonnative earthworms on plants and review what is currently known about the interaction between earthworms and AMF. We also illustrate how the effects of nonnative earthworms on plant-AMF mutualisms can alter the structure and stability of aboveground plant communities, as well as the vertebrate communities relying on these habitats. Integrative studies that assess the interactive effects of earthworms and AMF can provide new insights into the role that belowground ecosystem engineers play in altering aboveground ecological processes. Understanding these processes may improve our ability to predict the structure of plant and animal communities in earthworm-invaded regions and to develop management strategies that limit the numerous undesired impacts of earthworms.","ECOLOGY ","en",2016,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1890/15-1085.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1085","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;disturbance;earthworm invasion;ecosystem engineers;plant community;plant-soil interactions ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

We reconcile the discrepancy in diversity loss from invaders by showing that invaded communities have lower local richness but steeper species accumulation with area than that of uninvaded communities, leading to proportionately fewer species loss at broader spatial scales. We show that invaders drive scale-dependent biodiversity loss through strong neutral sampling effects on the number of individuals in a community. We also show that nonneutral species extirpations are due to a proportionately larger effect of invaders on common species, suggesting that rare species are buffered against extinction.

Stands managed using even-aged silvicultural systems in areas with high deer densities (> 20 deer km(-2)) had greater C. pensylvanica cover than stands managed using even-aged silvicultural systems in areas with lower deer densities (10-20 deer km(-2)), or unharvested second-growth communities. Stands managed using uneven-aged silvicultural systems were not significantly different from any other treatment group, regardless of deer density, There was a significant management X deer X earthworm interaction, and earthworm density had a positive relationship with C. pensylvanica cover in most management history X deer density combinations. High levels of disturbance associated with at least two of the three factors considered in this study were associated with high C. pensylvanica cover, but patterns across any single variable were inconsistent.

"Invasive earthworms deplete key soil inorganic nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and P) in a northern hardwood forest.","Kit Resner","Alex Blum","Hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region have evolved without earthworms since the Last Glacial Maximum, but are now being invaded by exotic earthworms introduced through agriculture, fishing, and logging. These exotic earthworms are known to increase soil mixing, affect soil carbon storage, and dramatically alter soil morphology. Here we show, using an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in northern Minnesota, that such disturbances by exotic earthworms profoundly affect inorganic nutrient cycles in soils. Soil nutrient elemental concentrations (Ca, Mg, K, and P) were normalized to biogeochemically inert Zr to quantify their losses and gains. This geochemical normalization revealed that elements were highly enriched in the A horizon of pre-invasion soils, suggesting tight biological recycling of the nutrients. In the early stage of invasion, epi-endogeic earthworm species appeared to have been responsible for further enriching the elements in the A horizon possibly by incorporating leaf organic matter (OM). The arrival of geophagous soil mixing endogeic earthworms, however, was associated with near complete losses of these enrichments, which was related to the loss of OM in soils. Our study highlights that elemental concentrations may not be sufficient to quantify biogeochemical effects of earthworms. The geochemical normalization approach, which has been widely used to study soil formation, may help when determining how invasive soil organisms affect soil elemental cycles. More generally, this approach has potential for much wider use in studies of belowground nutrient dynamics. The results support the existing ecological literature demonstrating that invasive earthworms may ultimately reduce productivity in formerly glaciated forests under climate change.","ECOSYSTEMS ","en",2015,"Jan","USA","Israel","10.1007/s10021-014-9814-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9814-0","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region","hardwood forest;inorganic nutrient cycling;biological invasion;earthworms;geochemical mass balance;calcium;phosphorous;potassium;magnesium ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecosystem engineering effects on species diversity across ecosystems: a meta-analysis.","Gustavo Q. Romero","Julia Koricheva","Ecosystem engineering is increasingly recognized as a relevant ecological driver of diversity and community composition. Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta‐analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (&lt;1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for &gt;1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS ","en",2015,"Aug","Brazil","U.K","10.1111/brv.12138","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12138","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (122 studies)","Various","tropical versus temperate;facilitation;meta-analysis;ecosystem engineers;functional group;richness;diversity;indirect interactions;""stress-gradient hypothesis"";'metafor' ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive earthworms interact with abiotic conditions to influence the invasion of common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica).","Alexander M. Roth","Peter B. Reich","Common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) is one of the most abundant and ecologically harmful non-native plants in forests of the Upper Midwest United States. At the same time, European earthworms are invading previously glaciated areas in this region, with largely anecdotal evidence suggesting they compound the negative effects of buckthorn and influence the invasibility of these forests. Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States. Hence, researchers and managers should consider co-invasion of plants and earthworms when investigating invasibility and creating preemptive or post-invasion management plans.","OECOLOGIA","en",2014,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-014-3175-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3175-4","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","forests of the Upper Midwest ","Light;Leaf litter;Invasibility;Lumbricus terrestris;Rhamnus cathartica ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Indirect and direct effects of exotic earthworms on soil nutrient and carbon pools in North American temperate forests.","Tara E. Sackett","Nathan Basiliko","Earthworm invasions in North American temperate forests cause considerable changes to soil and litter horizons, which can lead to changes in soil biogeochemistry and plant communities. These ecosystem changes have complex causal relationships, and the cascades of indirect effects from earthworm burrowing and feeding may have larger net effects on soil biogeochemistry than direct effects. In this study we partitioned the effects of earthworms on particular soil nutrient and carbon pools into direct and indirect effects. We defined direct effects as consisting of the association between the soil nutrient or carbon pool and earthworm biomass, whilst indirect effects included the impacts earthworms have on these soil pools through changing litter layer depth and soil chemical and biotic factors. We quantified these direct and indirect effects using a path analysis approach applied to data collected from 24 plots across an earthworm gradient in a northern hardwood forest stand in Ontario, Canada. As potential predictors, we measured earthworm functional group biomass, litter depth, microbial biomass, soil pH, texture, and organic matter. We related these predictors to extractable nutrient and carbon concentrations, including nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. We found few direct effects and primarily indirect effects of earthworms on the soil nutrient and carbon pools we measured. Endogeic earthworms had the strongest indirect effects via changes to pH, microbial biomass carbon, and proportion of soil organic matter. Anecic earthworms only indirectly affected soil and nutrient pools through changes in pH, and epigeic earthworms did not have either direct or indirect effects. Because endogeic earthworms had indirect effects through changing multiple soil factors, for some soil and nutrient pools these indirect effects augmented each other (primarily yielding negative effects), although in some cases indirect positive effects mitigated negative effects. Overall, the net effects of exotic earthworms on soil and nutrient pools were mostly negative. Of particular concern was the potential exacerbation by endogeic earthworms of phosphorus limitation in N-saturated forest systems, as well as carbon loss from mineral soils in addition to losses from the forest floor.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",2013,"Feb","Canada ","Canada","10.1016/j.soilbio.2012815","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.015","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","temperate forests ","Exotic earthworms;Northern hardwood forest;Path analysis;Indirect effects;Nitrogen;Phosphorus;Carbon;Microbial biomass ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably wilt have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred.

"Positive interactions of nonindigenous species: invasional meltdown?","Daniel Simberloff"," Betsy Von Holle ","Study of interactions between pairs or larger groups of nonindigenous species has been subordinated in the literature to study of interactions between nonindigenous and native species. To the extent that interactions among introduced species are depicted at all, the emphasis has been on negative interactions, primarily resource competition and interference. However, a literature search reveals that introduced species frequently interact with one another and that facilitative interactions are at least as common as detrimental ones. The population significance of these interactions has rarely been determined, but a great variety of types of direct and indirect interactions among individuals of different nonindigenous species is observed, and many are plausibly believed to have consequences at the population level. In particular, mutualisms between plants and the animals that disperse and/or pollinate them and modification of habitat by both animals and plants seem common and often important in facilitating invasions. There is little evidence that interference among introduced species at levels currently observed significantly impedes further invasions, and synergistic interactions among invaders may well lead to accelerated impacts on native ecosystems – an invasional ‘meltdown’ process.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","en",1999,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1111/ele.14127/v1/review1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.14127/v1/review1","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (we used a database)","Various","biotic resistance;dispersal agent;facilitation;habitat modification;indirect effects;mutualism;pollination;synergism ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

We expected to observe a mixture of native and non-native species at the sites because the region has never been glaciated. The fauna was dominated by European lumbricids. Density and biomass varied between 5 and 288 ind m(-2) and 5.2 and 144.0 g m(-2), respectively, with urban forests having higher abundances than rural forests. In laboratory incubations, urban forest soils had higher potential N-transformation rates. Both N-mineralization and nitrification rates were positively correlated with soil pH. However, controls on earthworm communities and N-cycling are complex in the Baltimore region, because parent material and soil type also change along the urban-rural gradient.

"Belowground bud bank response to grazing under severe, short-term drought.","Benjamin L. VanderWeide","David C. Hartnett","While the effects of drought and grazing are often studied separately, these disturbances co-occur in grasslands worldwide and interactively influence population, community, and ecosystem processes. The effects of drought and grazing on the belowground bud bank may dictate the trajectory of community recovery because new shoots arise from belowground buds after disturbance in perennial grasslands. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of severe drought and grazing on the belowground bud bank and aboveground vegetation in the tallgrass prairie of northeast Kansas, USA. Contrary to our expectations, we observed changes in community structure and declines in species richness both above and below ground in response to drought and grazing. We also hypothesized that drought would reduce bud bank density of all taxonomic groups, but found that grass bud and shoot densities remained constant across all drought and grazing treatment combinations. While sedge and forb bud and shoot densities were reduced by drought, only sedge bud density declined to a greater extent when grazed under drought conditions. Live rhizome biomass did not vary by treatment and was highly correlated with bud bank density, suggesting that bud demography is tightly linked to the production and senescence of rhizomes. Despite the effects of drought and grazing on aboveground net primary productivity and community structure, our work suggests that grasses stabilize tallgrass prairie plant communities because their rhizomes and associated buds persist through co-occurring disturbances.","OECOLOGIA ","en",2015,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-015-3249-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3249-y","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","northeast Kansas","Climate change;Ecological stability;Herbivory;Water stress;Tallgrass prairie ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global meta-analysis reveals no net change in local-scale plant biodiversity over time.","Vellend, Mark","Wipf, Sonja","Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and > 16,000 nonexperimental, local- scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5- 261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ","en",2013,"Dec","Canada","Switzerland ","10.3410/f.718156878.793486656","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.718156878.793486656","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","spatial scale;permanent plots;ecosystem services ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecological impacts of invasive alien plants: a meta-analysis of their effects on species, communities and ecosystems.","Montserrat Vilà","Petr Pyšek","Biological invasions cause ecological and economic impacts across the globe. However, it is unclear whether there are strong patterns in terms of their major effects, how the vulnerability of different ecosystems varies and which ecosystem services are at greatest risk. We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.","ECOLOGY LETTERS ","en",2011,"Jul","Spain","Czechia ","10.1111/j.1461-0248.20111628.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01628.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (199 articles, meta-analysis)","Various (1041 field studies)","Biological invasions;bottom-up effects;diversity;ecological complexity;ecosystem functioning;effect size;exotic species;island;N-fixing;weeds ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive species triggers a massive loss of ecosystem services through a trophic cascade.","Walsh, Jake R.","Vander Zanden, M. Jake ","Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines inwater clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US$140 million (US$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US$86.5 million and US$163 million (US$430-US$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ","en",2016,"Apr","USA","USA","10.3410/f.726230400.793551925","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1600366113","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Lake Mendota ","invasive species;ecosystem service;eutrophication;Bythotrephes;Daphnia ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Terrestrial ecosystem responses to species gains and losses.","David A. Wardle","Wim H. Van der Putten","Ecosystems worldwide are losing some species and gaining others, resulting in an interchange of species that is having profound impacts on how these ecosystems function. However, research on the effects of species gains and losses has developed largely independently of one another. Recent conceptual advances regarding effects of species gain have arisen from studies that have unraveled the mechanistic basis of how invading species with novel traits alter biotic interactions and ecosystem processes. In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes.

"Resident plant diversity and introduced earthworms have contrasting effects on the success of invasive plants.","Timothy J. S. Whitfeld","Peter B. Reich","Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that resident species diversity is an important driver of community invasibility. Through trait-based processes, plants in communities with high resident species diversity occupy a wider range of ecological niches and are more productive than low diversity communities, potentially reducing the opportunities for invasion through niche preemption. In terrestrial plant communities, biotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms can also affect invasibility by reducing leaf litter stocks and influencing soil conditions. In a greenhouse experiment, we simultaneously manipulated resident species diversity and earthworm presence to investigate independent and interactive effects of these two variables on the success of several invasive plants. Higher diversity of resident species was associated with lower biomass of invasives, with the effect mediated through resident species biomass. The presence of earthworms had a strong positive effect on the biomass of invasive species across all levels of resident species diversity and a weaker indirect negative effect via decreased soil moisture. Earthworms also weakened the positive correlation between resident species diversity and productivity. We did not observe any interactive effects of resident species biomass and earthworms on invasive species success. Partitioning the net biodiversity effect indicated that selection effects increased with resident species diversity whereas complementarity effects did not. Results suggest that managing for diverse forest communities may decrease the susceptibility of these communities to invasions. However, the presence of introduced earthworms in previously earthworm-free sites may undermine these efforts. Furthermore, future studies of plant community invasibility should account for the effects of introduced earthworms.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2014,"Oct","USA","Australia","10.1007/s10530-014-0657-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0657-6","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","field survey in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest province of Minnesota","Biodiversity-ecosystem function;Functional diversity;Invasibility;Lumbricus terrestris;Rhamnus cathartica ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Selective vertical seed transport by earthworms: Implications for the diversity of grassland ecosystems.","Johann G. Zaller","Nina Saxler","Earthworms are suggested to play an important role for the plant diversity of grassland ecosystems. Here we tested whether (i) Lumbricus terrestris L. selectively feeds on seeds of grassland species, (ii) feeding patterns match with seed species present in surface casts in a permanent grassland, and (iii) grassland plant seeds deposited in different soil depths are transported by earthworms. Food choice experiments with 10 plant species (3 grass spp., 4 non-leguminous herb spp., 3 leguminous spp.) showed that earthworms significantly selected between the offered seeds and generally preferred herbaceous species over grass species. Seed species in grassland surface casts did not correlate with seed species preferred by earthworms in the feeding experiment. Mesocosm experiments with L. terrestris in sterilized soil where 3500 seeds m(-2) of Dactylis glomerata (grass), Taraxacum officinale, Rumex obtusifolius (non-leguminous herbs) and Trifolium repens (legume) were deposited in 2, 10, 20 and 30 cm depth showed a significantly different species-specific transport of the seeds both downward and upward the soil profile. Dependent on the initial deposition depth between 26% (seeds initially at 10 cm depth) and 56% (20 cm depth) of the seeds were transported by earthworms. After 90 days on average 585 germinable seeds m(-2) of D. glomerata, 94 seeds m-2 of T. officinale, 38 seeds m(-2) of R. obtusifolius but no seeds of T. repens were transported from deeper soil layers to the soil surface.

"Earthworms increase plant production: a meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","UK","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Keywords +: SOIL CARBON;MANAGEMENT;GROWTH;POOLS;AGROECOSYSTEMS;COMMUNITIES;TOLERANCE;BIOMASS;CO2 ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice-wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize-wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been used in these two environments to raise production sustainably and profitably. Benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global warming are also discussed. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to sustainably produce more food from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands.

"Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture.","Verena Seufert","Foley, Jonathan A.","Numerous reports have emphasized the need for major changes in the global food system: agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population, with rising demand for meat and high-calorie diets, while simultaneously minimizing its global environmental impacts(1,2). Organic farming-a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans-is often proposed as a solution(3,4). However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and bio-diversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices(5). Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions-that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions-organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.","NATURE ","en",2012,"May","The Netherlands","USA","10.1016/b978-0-08-100596-5.22027-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-100596-5.22027-1","10.1038/srep06365","Various (comprehensive meta-analysis)","Various ","Ketwords +: PRODUCTIVITY;METAANALYSES;AVAILABILITY;CHALLENGE;EQUALITY;LEGUMEFEED ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Effects of earthworms on plant growth: patterns and perspectives.","Stefan Scheu","Stefan Scheu","A total of 67 studies were located in which the response of plants to presence of earthworms was investigated. The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","Pedobiologia","en",2002,"Sep","Germany","Germany","10.1078/0031-4056-00270","http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0031-4056-00270","10.1038/srep06365","Various (review)","Various ","Lumbricidae;rhizosphere;animal-plant interactions;indirect effects;food-web ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The role of biomass allocation in the growth response of plants to different levels of light, CO2, nutrients and water: a quantitative review.","Hendrik Poorter","Oscar Nagel","The allocation of biomass to different plantorgans depends on species, ontogeny and on the environment experienced by theplant. In this paper we first discuss some methodological tools to describeand analyse the allocation of biomass. Rather than the use of shoot:rootratios, we plead strongly for a subdivision of biomass into at least threecompartments: leaves, stems and roots. Attention is drawn to some of thedisadvantages of allometry as a tool to correct for size differences betweenplants. Second, we tested the extent to which biomass allocation of plantsfollows the model of a ‘functional equilibrium’. According to thismodel, plants respond to a decrease in above-ground resources with increasedallocation to shoots (leaves), whereas they respond to a decrease inbelow-ground resources with increased allocation to roots. We carried out ameta-analysis of the literature, analysing the effect of various environmentalvariables on the fraction of total plant biomass allocated to leaves (leafmass fraction), stem (stem mass fraction) and roots (root mass fraction). Theresponses to light, nutrients and water agreed with the (qualitative)prediction of the ‘functional equilibrium’ theory. The notableexception was atmospheric CO2, which did not affectallocation when the concentration was doubled. Third, we analysed thequantitative importance of the changes in allocation compared to changes inother growth parameters, such as unit leaf rate (the net difference betweencarbon gain and carbon losses per unit time and leaf area), and specific leafarea (leaf area: leaf biomass). The effects of light,CO2 and water on leaf mass fractions were small comparedto their effects on relative growth rate. The effects of nutrients, however,were large, suggesting that only in the case of nutrients, biomass allocationis a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply.","AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY ","en",2000,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1071/pp99173","http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pp99173","10.1038/srep06365","NEWCASTLE","AUSTRALIA","Keywords +: FUNCTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM;SHOOT RATIOS;ROOT RATIO;CARBON;NITROGEN;TEMPERATURE;RESPIRATION;PRODUCTIVITY;SEEDLINGS;OPINION ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Earthworms influence the production of above- and belowground biomass and the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ulrike Jana","Anne Repellin","To better understand the complex mechanisms of action of earthworms on plants, we set up an experimental system using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh, Aporrectodea caliginosa a common temperate earthworm and two types of soil with contrasted contents in organic matter and nutrients. Changes in plant biomass, biomass allocation to roots, leaves and stems and C/N ratios were related to variations in the expression of several plant genes involved in cellular division and stress responses and with earthworm-induced alterations in soil mineral status.  In the poorest soil, i.e. with low contents in mineral nutrient and organic matter, earthworms increased soil nitrate content very significantly and boosted plant aboveground biomass production. This correlated with changes in leaf transcript accumulation suggesting enhanced cell division and lesser incidence of reactive oxygen species. In the richer soil, earthworms had no significant effect on the production of aerial biomass. However, several plant responses were observed regardless of soil quality: enhanced accumulation of an auxin-responsive transcript in the leaves, a strong decrease in root length and biomass and a reduction in C/N values, particularly in the bolt stems. Although these results pointed out earthworm-induced enhancement of mineralization as a determining factor in the formidable plant growth responses, the release in the drilosphere of phytohormone-like compounds by earthworm-activated bacteria was most likely implicated as well in this process and resulted in ""forced"" nitrogen uptake by the plants. The herein demonstrated sensitivity of the model plant A. thaliana to earthworms shows that such new experimental set up could become a central key to the development of multidisciplinary investigations on plant-soil interactions.

"Signal Molecules Mediate the Impact of the Earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa on Growth, Development and Defence of the Plant Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ruben Puga-Freitas","Manuel Blouin","Earthworms have generally a positive impact on plant growth, which is often attributed to a trophic mechanism: namely, earthworms increase the release of mineral nutrients from soil litter and organic matter. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed since the discovery of a signal molecule (Indole Acetic Acid) in earthworm faeces. In this study, we used methodologies developed in plant science to gain information on ecological mechanisms involved in plant-earthworm interaction, by looking at plant response to earthworm presence at a molecular level. First, we looked at plant overall response to earthworm faeces in an in vitro device where only signal molecules could have an effect on plant growth; we observed that earthworms were inducing positive or negative effects on different plant species. Then, using an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with an impaired auxin transport, we demonstrated the potential of earthworms to stimulate root growth and to revert the dwarf mutant phenotype. Finally, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana in the presence and absence of earthworms; we found that genes modulated in the presence of earthworms are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, or to the application of exogenous hormones. A comparison of our results with other studies found in databases revealed strong analogies with systemic resistance, induced by signal molecules emitted by Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria and/or elicitors emitted by non-virulent pathogens. Signal molecules such as auxin and ethylene, which are considered as major in plant-microorganisms interactions, can also be of prior importance to explain plant-macroinvertebrates interactions.

"Changes in soil N pools in response to earthworm population manipulations in agroecosystems with different N sources.","J.M. Blair","B.R. Stinner","Responses of soil N pools to field manipulation of earthworm populations (reduced, unaltered or increased each spring and autumn) were evaluated within each of three agroecosystems based on different N sources: NH4NO3 fertilizer, cow manure or a legume-rye winter cover crop. Our objectives were to determine the effects of earthworms on soil N dynamics in agroecosystems based on different organic or inorganic sources of N, and to examine potential interactive effects of agroecosystem treatments and field-scale earthworm manipulations on soil N pools and potential N losses. Earthworm manipulations began in spring 1991, and were repeated each spring and fall. Soil microbial biomass N was determined by fumigation-extraction on six dates in 1992 and four dales in 1993. Extractable inorganic soil N (0-15 cm) was measured in January and approximately every 2 weeks during the growing seasons of 1992 and 1993. Additionally, the post-growing season vertical distribution (0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm) of extractable soil NO3-N was evaluated in November of 1992 and 1993. Earthworm manipulations affected microbial biomass N and extractable inorganic N pools in bulk soil samples. Microbial biomass N was significantly higher in the earthworm reduction treatments. There were significant earthworm x agroecosystem interactions affecting soil NO3. In the inorganically fertilized system, earthworm additions resulted in elevated amounts of extractable NO3 during the growing season of both years. Extractable NH4 concentrations were increased by earthworm additions in 1993, but only in the inorganically fertilized system. Earthworm additions also increased the concentration of soil NO3 at lower depths after the growing season, especially in the inorganically fertilized system. These results suggest that earthworms can alter N cycling processes in agroecosystems, and that these changes are sufficient to be detected by bulk soil sampling. Our results also indicate that the net effects of earthworm activity can vary with agroecosystem management practices. Earthworms may increase N availability by reducing microbial immobilization and enhancing mineralization. However, increased amounts of soil NO3 at the end of the growing season, and increased concentrations in lower soil horizons, could lead to increased leaching losses from inorganically fertilized systems: The implications of these changes for ecosystem-level nutrient fluxes will require further investigation.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",1997,"Mar – Apr","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00098-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00098-3","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wayne","Keywords +: NITROGEN;CARBON;SCALE ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm species composition affects the soil bacterial community and net nitrogen mineralization.","Maria B. Postma-Blaauw","Lijbert Brussaard","Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the rote of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological. group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological. groups (epigeic: Lumbricus rubellus; endogeic: Aporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: Lumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial. community, and on nitrogen mineralization from N-15-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter.  Our results indicate that L. rubellus and L. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas A. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, L. rubellus and A. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil, organic matter, whereas L. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial. community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between L. rubellus and A. caliginosa, and L. rubellus and L. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity.

"Inorganic and organic phosphorus pools in earthworm casts (Glossoscolecidae) and a Brazilian rainforest Oxisol.","Christienne N. Kuczak","Flavio J. Luizão","We compared differences in soil phosphorus fractions between large earthworm casts (Family Glossoscolecidae) and surrounding soils, i.e., Oxisols in 10 year-old upland agroforestry system (AGR), pasture (PAS), and secondary forest (SEC) in the Central Brazilian Amazon. AGR and PAS both received low-input fertilization and SEC received no fertilization. We found that earthworm casts had higher levels of organic hydroxide P than surrounding soils, whereas fertilization increased inorganic hydroxide P. Inorganic P was increased by fertilization, and organic P was increased by earthworm gut passage and/or selection of ingested materials, which increased available P (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) and moderately available P (sum of hydroxide and dilute acid fractions), and P fertilizer application and land-use increased available P. The use of a modified sequential P fractionation produced fewer differences between earthworm casts and soils than were expected. We suggest the use of a condensed extraction procedure with three fractions (Available P, Moderately Available P, and Resistant P) that provide an ecologically based understanding of the P availability in soil. Earthworm casts were estimated to constitute 41.0, 38.2, and 26.0 kg ha(-1) of total available P stocks (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) in the agroforestry system, pasture, and secondary forest, respectively.

"Effects of earthworms on Phosphorus dynamics - a review."," R.C. Le Bayon","Roxane Milleret ","Belowground biotic interactions are known to influence soil fertility and plant growth by changing the physical environment and the soil nutrient cycles. Among the great diversity of soil biota, earthworms are keystone soil organisms in regulating nutrient cycling through: (i) their own metabolism that leads to high availability of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from metabolic wastes such as urine, mucus and tissue, (ii) the dispersal and the stimulation of soil microorganism activity associated with passage through the intestinal tract and (iii) the distribution and the mixing of organic matter and soil mineral particles. While many studies have examined impacts of earthworm on C and N fluxes in soils, less attention has been paid to the impact of earthworms on soil phosphorus (P). This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the global earthworm’s impact on soil P dynamics in order to evaluate further involvements: i) on plant production and ii) on P transfer by runoff waters at the plot scale. This mini-review aims at considering research issues at several ecological levels, from individual earthworms (P distribution during food assimilation and excretion; gut microbial activities) to earthworm populations and communities (ecological categories and their influence on P dynamics) and, to the full extent, to the ecosystem scale (storage and/or loss of P). Interacting effects with other organisms (plants, microorganisms) are taken into account as well as the role of earthworms on physicochemical parameters (casting and burrowing activities, soil stability). Such a synthesis highlights the necessity to conduct interdisciplinary studies on biological, chemical and physical processes to better understand the effects of earthworms on P cycling at the ecosystem and landscape levels.","Dynamic Soil, Dynamic Plant (book)","en",2009,"N/A","Switzerland","Switzerland","10.1201/9781482285246-12","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40783737_Effects_of_Earthworms_on_Phosphorus_Dynamics_-_A_Review","10.1038/srep06365","Wordlwide (« terrestrial ecosystems »)","Various","drilosphere;ecological level;erosion;microorganism;plant","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Movement of N from decomposing earthworm tissue to soil, microbial and plant N pools.","Joann K. Whalen","Jessica L. Vanarsdale","A microcosm experiment was made to determine the fate of nitrogen released from N-15-labelled decomposing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) in soil in the presence or absence of ryegrass seedlings (Lolium perenne). Earthworm tissue (2.0% N-15 atom enriched) was added to each microcosm. Nitrogen movement from earthworm tissue to soil N [mineral N (NH4-N + NO3-N), dissolved organic N (DON) and organic N], microbial biomass N and plant shoot N pools was determined by destructive sampling at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 d. Earthworm tissues decomposed rapidly, and no tissue was visible after 4 d. Initially in pots without plants, most of the N from earthworm tissue was found in the organic N pool, however, as much as 55% of the N from decomposing earthworm tissue was incorporated into microbial biomass after 2 d. Much less of the N from earthworm tissue was transformed into DON and mineral N forms after 2 d. The DON and mineral N pools contained 13-18% and 4-7% of the N from earthworm tissue, respectively, from d 2 to 16. By the end of the experiment, N from earthworm tissue in the microbial biomass N pool declined to 29% while the amount of N from earthworm tissue in the organic N pool increased to 49%. The increase in the organic N may have resulted from the production of new organic compounds such as microbial by-products. In pots with plants, N from earthworm tissue was rapidly incorporated into microbial biomass, and by d 2, the microbial biomass N pool contained 40% of the N from earthworm tissue. Mineral N, DON and microbial biomass N concentrations were lower in pots with ryegrass seedlings compared to pots without plants, and after d 2 declined to almost undetectable amounts because of rapid plant uptake. Between 42-52% of the N from earthworm tissue was found in the organic N pool from d 1 to 8, and then declined to 19% by d 16. After 16 d, over 70% of the N added as earthworm tissue was incorporated into plant shoot biomass. Our results demonstrate that the movement of N from dead earthworm tissue into microbial biomass was extremely rapid, and in pots without plants, much of this N was transformed into organic N forms, while in pots with ryegrass, most of the N from earthworm tissue accumulated in ryegrass shoots.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","en",1999,"Apr","Canada","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(97)00252-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(97)00252-6","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Wooster, Ohio","Keywords +: EXTRACTION METHOD;NITROGEN;BIOMASS;FUMIGATION ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Lofty","(1) Normal field populations of deep-burrowing or shallow-working earthworms were inoculated into small plots that had been sterilized with dichloropropane-dichloropropene (D.D.????), on a site that had been directly drilled with cereals for six successive years. Inoculation with deep-burrowing species (Lumbricus terrestris and Allolobophora longa) significantly increased barley plant populations and the weight and depth of roots and height and amount of foliage. Most of the straw debris on the soil surface was incorporated into the soil in the earthworm-inoculated plots, compared with very little in plots with no earthworms. Yield was also increased significantly by earthworm inoculation. (2) In box experiments, comparing the influence of natural and simulated earth-worm burrows on root growth, it was shown that, although the provision of channels for roots to grow was important, the improved root growth was also partially due to the lining of the burrows with more available nutrients than the surrounding soil. Other experiments demonstrated that the nitrogen from dead earthworms was insufficient to account for increased root growth.

"Land-use and land-management change: relationships with earthworm and fungi communities and soil structural properties.","David J Spurgeon","Jack H Faber","Background: Change in land use and management can impact massively on soil ecosystems. Ecosystem engineers and other functional biodiversity in soils can be influenced directly by such change and this in turn can affect key soil functions. Here, we employ meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of changes in land use and land management across a range of successional/extensification transitions (conventional arable -> no or reduced tillage -> grassland -> wooded land) on community metrics for two functionally important soil taxa, earthworms and fungi. An analysis of the relationships between community change and soil structural properties was also included.  Results: Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased earthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity and later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such as introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all changes, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether woodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on woodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during conversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil structure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group composition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on tillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were positively associated with soil microaggregate stability.  Conclusions: These findings raise the potential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation to regulation of soil structure and water flow.","BMC ECOLOGY ","en",2013,"Dec","UK ","The Netherlands","10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Meta analysis;Earthworm;Fungi;Functional biodiversity;Soil porosity;Microaggregate stability ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Soil fertility concepts over the past two centuries: the importance attributed to soil organic matter in developed and developing countries.","Christian Feller","Raphaël Manlay","The theories about plant nutrition and soil fertility varied widely from the antiquity to the middle of the nineteenth century, with major (Thaer A. 1809. Grundsatze der rationellen Landwirtschaft (1809-1812). Berlin (Germany): Realschulbuch Ed.) or minor (Liebig J. 1840. Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikultur und Physiologie. Braunschweig (Germany): Vieweg) importance attributed to soil humus or soil organic matter (SOM). The importance assigned to humus over the past two centuries will be developed in this historical paper. Intensification of agriculture in the twentieth century permitted an important increase in cultivated plant yield of food, fiber, wood, and biofuel production, not only in the northern countries, but also in some southern countries (e.g., India and China) with the emergence of the Green Revolution. However, the question of organic restitutions and the maintenance (or increase) of the SOM stock was, at times, not taken into consideration; consequently, there was a general decrease in SOM stock for many tropical soils. It is now widely accepted by scientists that SOM depletion is one of the major factors leading to degradation of ecosystem services and loss of ecosystem resilience: new alternatives are now necessary for the maintenance and/or increase in plant productivity and production of environmental services by agriculture. Therefore, this paper will also present some recent research in different tropical countries with a focus on agroecological management of tropical soils.","ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE ","en",2012,"Jan","France","France","10.1080/03650340.2012.693598","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2012.693598","10.1038/srep06365","Various (historical paper)","Various","soil fertility history;soil fertility concepts;soil organic matter;ecosystem services ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecology of arable land: perspectives and challenges","M. Clarholm","Berström L.","Over the past two decades, nutrient budgets have been constructed for a number of specific ecosystems ranging from croplands to forests. However, relatively few studies have focused on the transfers between and among ecosystem types. These transfers and their dynamics depend on properties of the landscape units themselves as well as various mechanisms that influence inter-ecosystem transfers driven by such as atmospheric, hydrological and biological conditions. The movements of nutrients, especially nitrogen, and phosphorous, are subject to several processes such as absorption, adsorption, transformation and immobilization. Thus, the particular pathway of transfer across the landscape and the rates of movement depend on both transfer mechanisms and ecosystem properties. This paper reviews the current understanding of nutrient flows across the landscape, suggests some generalities, and presents recommendations for future research.","Ecology of Arable Land — Perspectives and Challenges (book)","en",1989,"N/A","Sweden ","Sweden","10.1007/978-94-009-1021-8_23","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-1021-8_23","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"SOM management in the tropics: Why feeding the soil macrofauna?","Patrick Lavelle","Jean-Pierre Rossi","This paper synthesises information on the food requirements of soil macroinvertebrates and some of their effects on soil organic matter dynamics. Some clues to techniques that would optimise their activities through organic matter management are suggested. Soil macroinvertebrates can consume almost any kind of organic residues in mutualistic association with soil microflora. Significant amounts estimated at several T per ha of predominantly easily assimilable C are used yearly in natural ecosystems as energy to sustain these activities. Sources of C used are highly variable depending on the feeding regime. The largest part of the energy assimilated (e.g., 50% by the tropical earthworm Millsonia anomala) is actually spent in burrowing and soil transport and mixing. Bioturbation often affects several thousand tons of soil per hectare per year and several tenth of m3 of voids are created in soil. A great diversity of biogenic structures accumulate and their nature and persistance over time largely controls hydraulic soil properties. The OM integrated into the compact biogenic structures (termite mounds, earthworm globular casts) is often protected from further decomposition. Most management practices have negative effects on the diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrate communities. Structures inherited from faunal activities may persist for some weeks to years and the relationship between their disappearance and soil degradation is rarely acknowledged. When SOM supply is maintained but diversity is not, the accumulation in excess of structures of one single category may have destructive effects on soil. It is therefore essential to design practices that provide the adequate organic sources to sustain the activity and diversity of invertebrates. Special attention should also be paid to the spatial array of plots and rotations in time.","Managing Organic Matter in Tropical Soils: Scope and Limitations (book)","en",2001,"N/A","France","France","10.1007/978-94-017-2172-1_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-2172-1_6","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","earthworms;macrofauna;organic matter management;soil structure;tropical soils","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"An overview of some tillage impacts on earthworm population abundance and diversity - implications for functioning in soils.","K.Y Chan","K.Y Chan","Conflicting reports in the literature on the effects of tillage on earthworms are reviewed in the light of their roles in agroecosystem functioning. Tillage can change the abundance (by 2-9 times) as well as the composition (diversity) of earthworm populations. The actual impact is dependent on soil factors, climatic conditions and the tillage operations but hitherto this information was seldom provided in research reports. The declines in earthworm population often reported in conventionally tilled soils are associated with undesirable changes in the soil environmental conditions resulting from excessive tillage. Different species of earthworm respond differently to tillage. While the abundance of the deep burrowing species (anecic) tends to decline under tillage, particularly under deep ploughing, endogeic species can actually increase in number especially when there is increased food supply. Under conservation tillage systems, earthworms can potentially play a more important role than under conventional tillage in the functioning of the farming systems because of their abilities to modify the soil physical environment and nutrient cycling. However, adoption of conservation tillage does not automatically result in an optimal earthworm population in terms of abundance and diversity. There are opportunities to introduce more beneficial species to improve the ecological performance of agro-ecosystems. More research is needed to fully understand the ecology of different earthworm species, their interactions and their potential roles in promoting more sustainable farming systems.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of warming on ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics is not available. Here, we compiled data of 528 observations from 51 papers and carried out a meta-analysis of experimental warming effects on 13 variables related to terrestrial N pools and dynamics. We found that, on average, net N mineralization and net nitrification rate were increased by 52.2 and 32.2%, respectively, under experimental warming treatment. N pools were also increased by warming, although the magnitude of this increase was less than that of N fluxes. Soil microbial N and N immobilization were not changed by warming, probably because microbes are limited by carbon sources. Grassland and shrubland/heathland were less responsive to warming than forest, probably because the reduction of soil moisture by warming offset the temperature effect in these areas. Soil heating cable and all-day treatment appeared to be the most effective method on N cycling among all treatment methods. Results of this meta-analysis are useful for better understanding the response of N cycling to global warming and the underlying mechanism of warming effects on plants and ecosystem functions.","NEW PHYTOLOGIST ","en",2013,"Jul","China","China","10.2307/3060925","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3060925","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","increased temperature;mineralization;N cycling processes;nitrification;nitrogen fluxes","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

This analysis provides an extremely useful framework for categorizing species for management purposes but also has relevance to conservation of rare, native species with limited environmental plasticity. An analysis of the origin and structure of earthworm communities in the tropics reveals that earthworms comprise 40–90% of the macrofaunal biomass in most tropical ecosystems, except for annually cropped systems. Their importance to faunal biomass in tropical forests calls into question the prevailing view that other soil groups, such as ants or termites, are more important than earthworms in organic matter processing and soil turnover in the tropics. As in temperate ecosystems, earthworms account for the bulk of the soil animal biomass, except where they are limited by lack of moisture. Interestingly, native species apparently survive better in managed systems of India and Africa than in Mexico and Central America, possibly due to the greater geographical isolation of Central America relative to the other regions. The chapter on environmental tolerance of earthworms that have extended distribution helps to explain why these species are so successful and suggests that they may have different effects on N mineralization than native endemic species.The next three chapters of the book deal, in turn, with the effects of earthworms on plant production, soil physical properties and organic matter and nutrient dynamics. The chapter on plant production contains perhaps the most extensive analysis of the influence of earthworms on plant growth ever undertaken. Summarizing over 240 results the authors show that most studies report an increase of growth in plant shoots and grain yield in the presence of earthworms and that the greatest increases occur in sandy soils with low organic matter content. This chapter also does an excellent job of summarizing the mechanisms by which earthworms may enhance worm growth, although there remain many uncertainties in this area.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2000,"Jun","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00026-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00026-2","10.1038/srep06365","Various","Various","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm communities in grasslands and horticultural soils.","W. A. M. Didden","W. A. M. Didden","In a survey of 42 farm sites, comprising grassland and two types of horticultural farms (growing vegetables or flower bulbs), earthworm communities were sampled by hand-sorting and a number of soil physicochemical characteristics recorded. For heavy metals the availability in the soil solution was estimated based on the measured absolute content. Abundance, biomass and species richness were significantly higher in grassland soils than in horticultural soils, and within the horticultural farms significantly higher in vegetable than in flower-bulb farms. No epigeic species were found in horticultural soils. The differences between the various farm types were probably related to the intensity of management practices, such as soil tillage, harvesting and crop protection measures, that result in less soil organic matter of lower quality. The data from the grassland farms were analyzed in conjunction with the physico-chemical soil characteristics, applying canonical correspondence analysis. Community parameters such as species richness and diversity apparently were not related to soil characteristics, but an appreciable part of the variation in abundance and biomass of several individual species could be explained by factors such as lutum content (particles < 16 m), pH, bio-availability of metal ions and geographical position of the sample site. It is concluded that repeated surveys of this type may become a valuable tool for monitoring soil quality.","BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS ","en",2001,"Feb","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1007/s003740000297","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003740000297","10.1038/srep06365","The Netherlands","marine clay, sandy soil, The Netherlands","Earthworms;Grassland;Community;Structure;Survey ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Keys to Soil Taxonomy.","Soil Survey Staff","Soil Survey Staff","For decades, NRCS has worked with soil scientists from around the world to increase awareness and expand knowledge of the importance of soil and its impact on all aspects of life. The translation expands the horizons of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy by allowing professionals around the world to apply and interpret the system in a more uniform and consistent way. While soils differ globally, the ability to apply a system that is universally understood and accepted is a goal shared by many soil scientists.  As the world struggles with global warming and other environmental challenges, having a universally accepted method that can be applied when soil problems are addressed will contribute to successful outcomes. Soil scientists and other professionals from Latin America, the United States, and other countries will benefit from this translation effort for years to come.","USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service","en",2022,"N/A","USA","USA","10.2136/sh2003.3101","https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/guides-and-instructions/keys-to-soil-taxonomy","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Are miroorganisms more effective than plants at competing for nitrogen?","Angela Hodge","Alastair Fitter","Plant scientists have long debated whether plants or microorganisms are the superior competitor for nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. Microorganisms have traditionally been viewed as the victors but recent evidence that plants can take up organic nitrogen compounds intact and can successfully acquire N from organic patches in soil raises the question anew. We argue that the key determinants of ‘success’ in nitrogen competition are spatial differences in nitrogen availability and in root and microbial distributions, together with temporal differences in microbial and root turnover. Consequently, it is not possible to discuss plant–microorganism competition without taking into account this spatiotemporal context.","TRENDS IN PLANT SCIENCE ","en",2000,"Jul","UK","UK","10.1016/s1360-1385(00)01656-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1360-1385(00)01656-3","10.1038/srep06365","UK","N/A","Plant science;Ecology;Soil hetrogenicity;Micro-organisms;Nitrogen;Competition;Mycorrhiza","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Element interactions limit soil carbon storage.","Kees-Jan van Groenigen","Chris van Kessel","Rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are thought to increase C sinks in terrestrial ecosystems. The potential of these sinks to mitigate CO2  emissions, however, may be constrained by nutrients. By using metaanalysis, we found that elevated CO2 only causes accumulation of soil C when N is added at rates well above typical atmospheric N inputs. Similarly, elevated CO2 only enhances N2 fixation, the major natural process providing soil N input, when other nutrients (e.g., phosphorus, molybdenum, and potassium) are added. Hence, soil C sequestration under elevated CO2 is constrained both directly by N availability and indirectly by nutrients needed to support N;;  2;;  fixation.;;","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ","en",2006,"Apr","UK","USA","10.1073/pnas509038103","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0509038103","10.1038/srep06365","Various (We extracted results for soil C contents, root biomass, and N2 fixation from atmospheric CO2 enrichment studies conducted in the field)","Various","global climate change;N-2 fixation;soil organic matter ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The role of residues management in sustainable agricultural systems.","R. Lal","R. Lal","Crop residues returned to the soil can maintain or enhance soil quality and productivity through favorable effects on soil properties and life-support processes. In the U.S., crop residues produced by 19 principal crops are estimated at 400 million Mg/yr, compared with 2952 million Mg/yr produced in the world. Crop residues returned to the soil contribute to the maintenance of and an increase in soil organic carbon content and add plant nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirements. Total amount of principal nutrients in crop residues range from 40 to 100 Kg/Mg. Consumption of fertilizers in 1991 was 116 million Mg of N, P and K in the world and 16 million Mg in the U.S. In comparison, nutrients (N + P + K) contained in crop residues amount to 9 million Mg/yr in the U.S, and 74 million Mg/yr in the world. Therefore, a considerable quantity of fertilizers can be saved by returning the residues produced to the soil.  Residue management is also important in soil and water conservation. About 2.5 Mg/ha of crop residue applied as mulch can reduce soil loss by 60%. Water conservation is an equally important benefit of returning crop residue, especially for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. Water stored in the root zone increases with increasing amount of residue returned to the soil. There are also snow retention benefits of crop residue mulch.  Fuel value is estimated at 18.6 x 10(9) J or 2 bbl of oil per Mg of crop residues. Total fuel value is estimated at 7 EJ/yr (1 EJ = Exa Joule = 1 x 10(18) Joules) in the U.S, and 64 EJ/yr in the world. Management of crop residues can also be a useful strategy for sequestering carbon into the soil, and reducing emissions of radiatively-active gases into the atmosphere: About 1.5 Pg (1 Pg = 1 peta gram = 1 x 10(15) g) of carbon Is stored in the crop residues produced annually in the world.  Crop residues influence agricultural sustainability by enhancing productivity. Productivity increases with residue returned are greater with low rates of fertilizers than with high or recommended rates. Generally there is a synergistic effect between residue returned and fertilizer use. Innovative cropping systems should be developed to produce the desired amount of crop residue for alternative uses and returning surplus to the soil. In this regard, cover crops and conservation tillage systems can play an important role in designing appropriate cropping/farming systems.","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE","en",1995,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1300/j064v05n04_06","http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j064v05n04_06","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Various","Keywords +: CARBON","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The meta-analysis of response ratios in experimental ecology.","Larry V. Hedges","Peter S. Curtis","Meta-analysis provides formal statistical techniques for summarizing the results of independent experiments and is increasingly being used in ecology. The response ratio (the ratio of mean outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group) and closely related measures of proportionate change are often used as measures of effect magnitude in ecology. Using these metrics for meta-analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties, but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of response-ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses.","Ecology","en",1999,"Jun","USA","USA","10.2307/177062","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/177062","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","effect size;elevated CO2;plant biomass responses;meta-analysis in experimental ecology;meta-analysis of response ratios;research synthesis;response ratio;statistical techniques","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Assessing the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon: A comparison of four meta-analyses.","BRUCE A. HUNGATE","CRAIG W. OSENBERG","Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta‐analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta‐analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta‐analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta‐analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta‐analysis, suggesting the continued need for long‐term experiments.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","en",2009,"Aug","USA","USA","10.1111/j.1365-2486.20091866.x","https://ecoss.nau.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HUNGATE_et_al-2009-Global_Change_Biology.pdf","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis comparison)","Various","C sequestration;effect size;elevated CO2;meta-analysis;soil C;statistical power ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Statistical Methods for Meta-analysis.","Nelson, Jon P.","Nelson, Jon P.","Meta-analysis is the quantitative synthesis of multiple primary studies containing estimates of similar empirical magnitudes or effect sizes. Meta-analysis allows generalizations about the underlying population of effects and increases the power of statistical tests. Meta-regression analysis can control statistically for factual heterogeneity, methodological diversity, and possible biases among the primary studies. In the context of benefit transfers, meta-analysis can produce reduced-form functions that identify and test systematic influences of study, economic, and resource attributes on willingness to pay and other environmental valuations. This chapter provides an introduction to basic statistical methods employed in meta-analysis, including weighted-averages and meta-regressions. The chapter identifies and discusses solutions to several econometric problems commonly associated with metadata, including heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity, correlated effects, and publication bias. Basic statistical concepts and methods are illustrated using a sample of estimates for the value of a statistical life, including within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.

"A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form and physiology.","Peter S. Curtis","Xianzhong Wang","Quantitative integration of the literature on the effect of elevated CO2 on woody plants is important to aid our understanding of forest health in coming decades and to better predict terrestrial feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (WT) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of WT by half, from + 31 % under optimal conditions to + 16 %, while low light increased the response to + 52 %. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+ 19 %) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+ 54 %). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots < 0.51 (- 36 %) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 (- 18 % and - 16 % respectively, data expressed on a leaf mass basis), while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust, statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO2 effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization.","OECOLOGIA ","en",1998,"Feb","USA","USA","10.1007/s004420050381","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050381","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","elevated CO2;meta-analysis;woody plants ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
