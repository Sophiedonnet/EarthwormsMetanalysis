"Earthworms increase plant production: a meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","UK","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Keywords +: SOIL CARBON;MANAGEMENT;GROWTH;POOLS;AGROECOSYSTEMS;COMMUNITIES;TOLERANCE;BIOMASS;CO2 ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Food security: the challenge of feeding 9 billion people.","Godfray, H. Charles J.","Toulmin, Camilla","Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.","Science","en",2010,"Feb","England","England","10.1093/oso/978019511312903028","https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1185383","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","Keywords +: LAND;AGRICULTURE;SUSTAINABILITY;IMPACT;YIELDS ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The role of conservation agriculture in sustainable agriculture.","Hobbs, Peter R.","Raj Gupta, Rishi","The paper focuses on conservation agriculture (CA), defined as minimal soil disturbance (no-till, NT) and permanent soil cover (mulch) combined with rotations, as a more sustainable cultivation system for the future. Cultivation and tillage play an important role in agriculture. The benefits of tillage in agriculture are explored before introducing conservation tillage (CT), a practice that was borne out of the American dust bowl of the 1930s. The paper then describes the benefits of CA, a suggested improvement on CT, where NT, mulch and rotations significantly improve soil properties and other biotic factors. The paper concludes that CA is a more sustainable and environmentally friendly management system for cultivating crops. Case studies from the rice-wheat areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains of South Asia and the irrigated maize-wheat systems of Northwest Mexico are used to describe how CA practices have been used in these two environments to raise production sustainably and profitably. Benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on global warming are also discussed. The paper concludes that agriculture in the next decade will have to sustainably produce more food from less land through more efficient use of natural resources and with minimal impact on the environment in order to meet growing population demands. Promoting and adopting CA management systems can help meet this goal.","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2008,"Feb","USA","India","10.1007/978-981-16-0827-8_25","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-0827-8_25","10.1038/srep06365","Asia, Mexico","Indo-Gangetic Plains,  South Asia, Northwest Mexico ","conservation agriculture;direct seeding;zero-tillage;rice-wheat systems;bed planting;mulching ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture.","Verena Seufert","Foley, Jonathan A.","Numerous reports have emphasized the need for major changes in the global food system: agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population, with rising demand for meat and high-calorie diets, while simultaneously minimizing its global environmental impacts(1,2). Organic farming-a system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans-is often proposed as a solution(3,4). However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and bio-diversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices(5). Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions-that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions-organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.","NATURE ","en",2012,"May","The Netherlands","USA","10.1016/b978-0-08-100596-5.22027-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-100596-5.22027-1","10.1038/srep06365","Various (comprehensive meta-analysis)","Various ","Ketwords +: PRODUCTIVITY;METAANALYSES;AVAILABILITY;CHALLENGE;EQUALITY;LEGUMEFEED ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"A review of earthworm impact on soil function and ecosystem services.","M. Blouin","J.‐J. Brun","Biodiversity is responsible for the provision of many ecosystem services; human well‐being is based on these services, and consequently on biodiversity. In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed ‘ecosystem engineers’. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate. The review aims to assist people involved in all aspects of land management, including conservation, agriculture, mining or other industries, to obtain a broad knowledge of earthworms and ecosystem services.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE ","en",2013,"Apr","France","France","10.1111/ejss.12025","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12025","10.1038/srep06365","England","South of England ","Keywords +: POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;NORTHERN HARDWOOD FORESTS;ORGANIC-MATTER DYNAMICS;NITROUS-OXIDE N2O;LUMBRICUS-TERRESTRIS;LONG-TERM;EISENIA-FOETIDA;BURROW SYSTEMS;PLANT-GROWTH;APORRECTODEA-TRAPEZOIDES ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Effects of earthworms on plant growth: patterns and perspectives.","Stefan Scheu","Stefan Scheu","A total of 67 studies were located in which the response of plants to presence of earthworms was investigated. The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","Pedobiologia","en",2002,"Sep","Germany","Germany","10.1078/0031-4056-00270","http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0031-4056-00270","10.1038/srep06365","Various (review)","Various ","Lumbricidae;rhizosphere;animal-plant interactions;indirect effects;food-web ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The role of biomass allocation in the growth response of plants to different levels of light, CO2, nutrients and water: a quantitative review.","Hendrik Poorter","Oscar Nagel","The allocation of biomass to different plantorgans depends on species, ontogeny and on the environment experienced by theplant. In this paper we first discuss some methodological tools to describeand analyse the allocation of biomass. Rather than the use of shoot:rootratios, we plead strongly for a subdivision of biomass into at least threecompartments: leaves, stems and roots. Attention is drawn to some of thedisadvantages of allometry as a tool to correct for size differences betweenplants. Second, we tested the extent to which biomass allocation of plantsfollows the model of a ‘functional equilibrium’. According to thismodel, plants respond to a decrease in above-ground resources with increasedallocation to shoots (leaves), whereas they respond to a decrease inbelow-ground resources with increased allocation to roots. We carried out ameta-analysis of the literature, analysing the effect of various environmentalvariables on the fraction of total plant biomass allocated to leaves (leafmass fraction), stem (stem mass fraction) and roots (root mass fraction). Theresponses to light, nutrients and water agreed with the (qualitative)prediction of the ‘functional equilibrium’ theory. The notableexception was atmospheric CO2, which did not affectallocation when the concentration was doubled. Third, we analysed thequantitative importance of the changes in allocation compared to changes inother growth parameters, such as unit leaf rate (the net difference betweencarbon gain and carbon losses per unit time and leaf area), and specific leafarea (leaf area: leaf biomass). The effects of light,CO2 and water on leaf mass fractions were small comparedto their effects on relative growth rate. The effects of nutrients, however,were large, suggesting that only in the case of nutrients, biomass allocationis a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply.","AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY ","en",2000,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1071/pp99173","http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pp99173","10.1038/srep06365","NEWCASTLE","AUSTRALIA","Keywords +: FUNCTIONAL EQUILIBRIUM;SHOOT RATIOS;ROOT RATIO;CARBON;NITROGEN;TEMPERATURE;RESPIRATION;PRODUCTIVITY;SEEDLINGS;OPINION ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Earthworms influence the production of above- and belowground biomass and the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ulrike Jana","Anne Repellin","To better understand the complex mechanisms of action of earthworms on plants, we set up an experimental system using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh, Aporrectodea caliginosa a common temperate earthworm and two types of soil with contrasted contents in organic matter and nutrients. Changes in plant biomass, biomass allocation to roots, leaves and stems and C/N ratios were related to variations in the expression of several plant genes involved in cellular division and stress responses and with earthworm-induced alterations in soil mineral status.  In the poorest soil, i.e. with low contents in mineral nutrient and organic matter, earthworms increased soil nitrate content very significantly and boosted plant aboveground biomass production. This correlated with changes in leaf transcript accumulation suggesting enhanced cell division and lesser incidence of reactive oxygen species. In the richer soil, earthworms had no significant effect on the production of aerial biomass. However, several plant responses were observed regardless of soil quality: enhanced accumulation of an auxin-responsive transcript in the leaves, a strong decrease in root length and biomass and a reduction in C/N values, particularly in the bolt stems. Although these results pointed out earthworm-induced enhancement of mineralization as a determining factor in the formidable plant growth responses, the release in the drilosphere of phytohormone-like compounds by earthworm-activated bacteria was most likely implicated as well in this process and resulted in ""forced"" nitrogen uptake by the plants. The herein demonstrated sensitivity of the model plant A. thaliana to earthworms shows that such new experimental set up could become a central key to the development of multidisciplinary investigations on plant-soil interactions.

"Signal Molecules Mediate the Impact of the Earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa on Growth, Development and Defence of the Plant Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ruben Puga-Freitas","Manuel Blouin","Earthworms have generally a positive impact on plant growth, which is often attributed to a trophic mechanism: namely, earthworms increase the release of mineral nutrients from soil litter and organic matter. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed since the discovery of a signal molecule (Indole Acetic Acid) in earthworm faeces. In this study, we used methodologies developed in plant science to gain information on ecological mechanisms involved in plant-earthworm interaction, by looking at plant response to earthworm presence at a molecular level. First, we looked at plant overall response to earthworm faeces in an in vitro device where only signal molecules could have an effect on plant growth; we observed that earthworms were inducing positive or negative effects on different plant species. Then, using an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with an impaired auxin transport, we demonstrated the potential of earthworms to stimulate root growth and to revert the dwarf mutant phenotype. Finally, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana in the presence and absence of earthworms; we found that genes modulated in the presence of earthworms are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, or to the application of exogenous hormones. A comparison of our results with other studies found in databases revealed strong analogies with systemic resistance, induced by signal molecules emitted by Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria and/or elicitors emitted by non-virulent pathogens. Signal molecules such as auxin and ethylene, which are considered as major in plant-microorganisms interactions, can also be of prior importance to explain plant-macroinvertebrates interactions. This could imply revisiting ecological theories which generally stress on the role of trophic relationships.","Plos One ","en",2012,"Dec","France","France","10.1371/journal.pone049504","https://doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049504","10.1038/srep06365","France","CEREEP research station (Saint-Pierre-Lès-Nemours, France)","Keywords +: SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE;PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA;AUXIN;EXPRESSION;ETHYLENE;TRANSCRIPTOME;EMERGENCE;PATHOGEN;MUTANTS;BIOMASS ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Changes in soil N pools in response to earthworm population manipulations in agroecosystems with different N sources.","J.M. Blair","B.R. Stinner","Responses of soil N pools to field manipulation of earthworm populations (reduced, unaltered or increased each spring and autumn) were evaluated within each of three agroecosystems based on different N sources: NH4NO3 fertilizer, cow manure or a legume-rye winter cover crop. Our objectives were to determine the effects of earthworms on soil N dynamics in agroecosystems based on different organic or inorganic sources of N, and to examine potential interactive effects of agroecosystem treatments and field-scale earthworm manipulations on soil N pools and potential N losses. Earthworm manipulations began in spring 1991, and were repeated each spring and fall. Soil microbial biomass N was determined by fumigation-extraction on six dates in 1992 and four dales in 1993. Extractable inorganic soil N (0-15 cm) was measured in January and approximately every 2 weeks during the growing seasons of 1992 and 1993. Additionally, the post-growing season vertical distribution (0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm) of extractable soil NO3-N was evaluated in November of 1992 and 1993. Earthworm manipulations affected microbial biomass N and extractable inorganic N pools in bulk soil samples. Microbial biomass N was significantly higher in the earthworm reduction treatments. There were significant earthworm x agroecosystem interactions affecting soil NO3. In the inorganically fertilized system, earthworm additions resulted in elevated amounts of extractable NO3 during the growing season of both years. Extractable NH4 concentrations were increased by earthworm additions in 1993, but only in the inorganically fertilized system. Earthworm additions also increased the concentration of soil NO3 at lower depths after the growing season, especially in the inorganically fertilized system. These results suggest that earthworms can alter N cycling processes in agroecosystems, and that these changes are sufficient to be detected by bulk soil sampling. Our results also indicate that the net effects of earthworm activity can vary with agroecosystem management practices. Earthworms may increase N availability by reducing microbial immobilization and enhancing mineralization. However, increased amounts of soil NO3 at the end of the growing season, and increased concentrations in lower soil horizons, could lead to increased leaching losses from inorganically fertilized systems: The implications of these changes for ecosystem-level nutrient fluxes will require further investigation.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",1997,"Mar – Apr","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00098-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00098-3","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wayne","Keywords +: NITROGEN;CARBON;SCALE ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm species composition affects the soil bacterial community and net nitrogen mineralization.","Maria B. Postma-Blaauw","Lijbert Brussaard","Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the rote of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological. group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological. groups (epigeic: Lumbricus rubellus; endogeic: Aporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: Lumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial. community, and on nitrogen mineralization from N-15-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter.  Our results indicate that L. rubellus and L. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas A. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, L. rubellus and A. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil, organic matter, whereas L. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial. community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between L. rubellus and A. caliginosa, and L. rubellus and L. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between A. caliginosa and L. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity.

"Inorganic and organic phosphorus pools in earthworm casts (Glossoscolecidae) and a Brazilian rainforest Oxisol.","Christienne N. Kuczak","Flavio J. Luizão","We compared differences in soil phosphorus fractions between large earthworm casts (Family Glossoscolecidae) and surrounding soils, i.e., Oxisols in 10 year-old upland agroforestry system (AGR), pasture (PAS), and secondary forest (SEC) in the Central Brazilian Amazon. AGR and PAS both received low-input fertilization and SEC received no fertilization. We found that earthworm casts had higher levels of organic hydroxide P than surrounding soils, whereas fertilization increased inorganic hydroxide P. Inorganic P was increased by fertilization, and organic P was increased by earthworm gut passage and/or selection of ingested materials, which increased available P (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) and moderately available P (sum of hydroxide and dilute acid fractions), and P fertilizer application and land-use increased available P. The use of a modified sequential P fractionation produced fewer differences between earthworm casts and soils than were expected. We suggest the use of a condensed extraction procedure with three fractions (Available P, Moderately Available P, and Resistant P) that provide an ecologically based understanding of the P availability in soil. Earthworm casts were estimated to constitute 41.0, 38.2, and 26.0 kg ha(-1) of total available P stocks (sum of resin and bicarbonate fractions) in the agroforestry system, pasture, and secondary forest, respectively.

"Effects of earthworms on Phosphorus dynamics - a review."," R.C. Le Bayon","Roxane Milleret ","Belowground biotic interactions are known to influence soil fertility and plant growth by changing the physical environment and the soil nutrient cycles. Among the great diversity of soil biota, earthworms are keystone soil organisms in regulating nutrient cycling through: (i) their own metabolism that leads to high availability of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from metabolic wastes such as urine, mucus and tissue, (ii) the dispersal and the stimulation of soil microorganism activity associated with passage through the intestinal tract and (iii) the distribution and the mixing of organic matter and soil mineral particles. While many studies have examined impacts of earthworm on C and N fluxes in soils, less attention has been paid to the impact of earthworms on soil phosphorus (P). This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the global earthworm’s impact on soil P dynamics in order to evaluate further involvements: i) on plant production and ii) on P transfer by runoff waters at the plot scale. This mini-review aims at considering research issues at several ecological levels, from individual earthworms (P distribution during food assimilation and excretion; gut microbial activities) to earthworm populations and communities (ecological categories and their influence on P dynamics) and, to the full extent, to the ecosystem scale (storage and/or loss of P). Interacting effects with other organisms (plants, microorganisms) are taken into account as well as the role of earthworms on physicochemical parameters (casting and burrowing activities, soil stability). Such a synthesis highlights the necessity to conduct interdisciplinary studies on biological, chemical and physical processes to better understand the effects of earthworms on P cycling at the ecosystem and landscape levels.","Dynamic Soil, Dynamic Plant (book)","en",2009,"N/A","Switzerland","Switzerland","10.1201/9781482285246-12","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40783737_Effects_of_Earthworms_on_Phosphorus_Dynamics_-_A_Review","10.1038/srep06365","Wordlwide (« terrestrial ecosystems »)","Various","drilosphere;ecological level;erosion;microorganism;plant","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Movement of N from decomposing earthworm tissue to soil, microbial and plant N pools.","Joann K. Whalen","Jessica L. Vanarsdale","A microcosm experiment was made to determine the fate of nitrogen released from N-15-labelled decomposing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) in soil in the presence or absence of ryegrass seedlings (Lolium perenne). Earthworm tissue (2.0% N-15 atom enriched) was added to each microcosm. Nitrogen movement from earthworm tissue to soil N [mineral N (NH4-N + NO3-N), dissolved organic N (DON) and organic N], microbial biomass N and plant shoot N pools was determined by destructive sampling at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 d. Earthworm tissues decomposed rapidly, and no tissue was visible after 4 d. Initially in pots without plants, most of the N from earthworm tissue was found in the organic N pool, however, as much as 55% of the N from decomposing earthworm tissue was incorporated into microbial biomass after 2 d. Much less of the N from earthworm tissue was transformed into DON and mineral N forms after 2 d. The DON and mineral N pools contained 13-18% and 4-7% of the N from earthworm tissue, respectively, from d 2 to 16. By the end of the experiment, N from earthworm tissue in the microbial biomass N pool declined to 29% while the amount of N from earthworm tissue in the organic N pool increased to 49%. The increase in the organic N may have resulted from the production of new organic compounds such as microbial by-products. In pots with plants, N from earthworm tissue was rapidly incorporated into microbial biomass, and by d 2, the microbial biomass N pool contained 40% of the N from earthworm tissue. Mineral N, DON and microbial biomass N concentrations were lower in pots with ryegrass seedlings compared to pots without plants, and after d 2 declined to almost undetectable amounts because of rapid plant uptake. Between 42-52% of the N from earthworm tissue was found in the organic N pool from d 1 to 8, and then declined to 19% by d 16. After 16 d, over 70% of the N added as earthworm tissue was incorporated into plant shoot biomass. Our results demonstrate that the movement of N from dead earthworm tissue into microbial biomass was extremely rapid, and in pots without plants, much of this N was transformed into organic N forms, while in pots with ryegrass, most of the N from earthworm tissue accumulated in ryegrass shoots.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY","en",1999,"Apr","Canada","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(97)00252-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(97)00252-6","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Wooster, Ohio","Keywords +: EXTRACTION METHOD;NITROGEN;BIOMASS;FUMIGATION ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Effects of earthworm inoculation upon the root-growth of direct drilled cereals.","C. A. Edwards","J. R. Lofty","(1) Normal field populations of deep-burrowing or shallow-working earthworms were inoculated into small plots that had been sterilized with dichloropropane-dichloropropene (D.D.????), on a site that had been directly drilled with cereals for six successive years. Inoculation with deep-burrowing species (Lumbricus terrestris and Allolobophora longa) significantly increased barley plant populations and the weight and depth of roots and height and amount of foliage. Most of the straw debris on the soil surface was incorporated into the soil in the earthworm-inoculated plots, compared with very little in plots with no earthworms. Yield was also increased significantly by earthworm inoculation. (2) In box experiments, comparing the influence of natural and simulated earth-worm burrows on root growth, it was shown that, although the provision of channels for roots to grow was important, the improved root growth was also partially due to the lining of the burrows with more available nutrients than the surrounding soil. Other experiments demonstrated that the nitrogen from dead earthworms was insufficient to account for increased root growth. Ways of encouraging the build-up of earthworm populations in direct drilled land are discussed.","JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY ","en",1980,"Dec","USA","England","10.2307/2402635","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2402635","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Land-use and land-management change: relationships with earthworm and fungi communities and soil structural properties.","David J Spurgeon","Jack H Faber","Background: Change in land use and management can impact massively on soil ecosystems. Ecosystem engineers and other functional biodiversity in soils can be influenced directly by such change and this in turn can affect key soil functions. Here, we employ meta-analysis to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of changes in land use and land management across a range of successional/extensification transitions (conventional arable -> no or reduced tillage -> grassland -> wooded land) on community metrics for two functionally important soil taxa, earthworms and fungi. An analysis of the relationships between community change and soil structural properties was also included.  Results: Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased earthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity and later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such as introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all changes, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether woodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on woodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during conversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil structure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group composition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on tillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were positively associated with soil microaggregate stability.  Conclusions: These findings raise the potential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation to regulation of soil structure and water flow.","BMC ECOLOGY ","en",2013,"Dec","UK ","The Netherlands","10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Meta analysis;Earthworm;Fungi;Functional biodiversity;Soil porosity;Microaggregate stability ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Soil fertility concepts over the past two centuries: the importance attributed to soil organic matter in developed and developing countries.","Christian Feller","Raphaël Manlay","The theories about plant nutrition and soil fertility varied widely from the antiquity to the middle of the nineteenth century, with major (Thaer A. 1809. Grundsatze der rationellen Landwirtschaft (1809-1812). Berlin (Germany): Realschulbuch Ed.) or minor (Liebig J. 1840. Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikultur und Physiologie. Braunschweig (Germany): Vieweg) importance attributed to soil humus or soil organic matter (SOM). The importance assigned to humus over the past two centuries will be developed in this historical paper. Intensification of agriculture in the twentieth century permitted an important increase in cultivated plant yield of food, fiber, wood, and biofuel production, not only in the northern countries, but also in some southern countries (e.g., India and China) with the emergence of the Green Revolution. However, the question of organic restitutions and the maintenance (or increase) of the SOM stock was, at times, not taken into consideration; consequently, there was a general decrease in SOM stock for many tropical soils. It is now widely accepted by scientists that SOM depletion is one of the major factors leading to degradation of ecosystem services and loss of ecosystem resilience: new alternatives are now necessary for the maintenance and/or increase in plant productivity and production of environmental services by agriculture. Therefore, this paper will also present some recent research in different tropical countries with a focus on agroecological management of tropical soils.","ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE ","en",2012,"Jan","France","France","10.1080/03650340.2012.693598","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03650340.2012.693598","10.1038/srep06365","Various (historical paper)","Various","soil fertility history;soil fertility concepts;soil organic matter;ecosystem services ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecology of arable land: perspectives and challenges","M. Clarholm","Berström L.","Over the past two decades, nutrient budgets have been constructed for a number of specific ecosystems ranging from croplands to forests. However, relatively few studies have focused on the transfers between and among ecosystem types. These transfers and their dynamics depend on properties of the landscape units themselves as well as various mechanisms that influence inter-ecosystem transfers driven by such as atmospheric, hydrological and biological conditions. The movements of nutrients, especially nitrogen, and phosphorous, are subject to several processes such as absorption, adsorption, transformation and immobilization. Thus, the particular pathway of transfer across the landscape and the rates of movement depend on both transfer mechanisms and ecosystem properties. This paper reviews the current understanding of nutrient flows across the landscape, suggests some generalities, and presents recommendations for future research.","Ecology of Arable Land — Perspectives and Challenges (book)","en",1989,"N/A","Sweden ","Sweden","10.1007/978-94-009-1021-8_23","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-1021-8_23","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"SOM management in the tropics: Why feeding the soil macrofauna?","Patrick Lavelle","Jean-Pierre Rossi","This paper synthesises information on the food requirements of soil macroinvertebrates and some of their effects on soil organic matter dynamics. Some clues to techniques that would optimise their activities through organic matter management are suggested. Soil macroinvertebrates can consume almost any kind of organic residues in mutualistic association with soil microflora. Significant amounts estimated at several T per ha of predominantly easily assimilable C are used yearly in natural ecosystems as energy to sustain these activities. Sources of C used are highly variable depending on the feeding regime. The largest part of the energy assimilated (e.g., 50% by the tropical earthworm Millsonia anomala) is actually spent in burrowing and soil transport and mixing. Bioturbation often affects several thousand tons of soil per hectare per year and several tenth of m3 of voids are created in soil. A great diversity of biogenic structures accumulate and their nature and persistance over time largely controls hydraulic soil properties. The OM integrated into the compact biogenic structures (termite mounds, earthworm globular casts) is often protected from further decomposition. Most management practices have negative effects on the diversity and abundance of macroinvertebrate communities. Structures inherited from faunal activities may persist for some weeks to years and the relationship between their disappearance and soil degradation is rarely acknowledged. When SOM supply is maintained but diversity is not, the accumulation in excess of structures of one single category may have destructive effects on soil. It is therefore essential to design practices that provide the adequate organic sources to sustain the activity and diversity of invertebrates. Special attention should also be paid to the spatial array of plots and rotations in time.","Managing Organic Matter in Tropical Soils: Scope and Limitations (book)","en",2001,"N/A","France","France","10.1007/978-94-017-2172-1_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-2172-1_6","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","earthworms;macrofauna;organic matter management;soil structure;tropical soils","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Organic inputs for soil fertility management in tropical agroecosystems: application of an organic resource database.","Cheryl A Palm","Ken E Giller","Organic resources play a critical role in both short-term nutrient availability and longer-term maintenance of soil organic matter in most smaller holder farming systems in the tropics. Despite this importance, there is little predictive understanding for the management of organic inputs in tropical agroecosystems. In this paper, an organic resource database (ORD) is introduced that contains information on organic resource quality parameters including macronutrient, lignin and polyphenol contents of fresh leaves, litter, stems and/or roots from almost 300 species found in tropical agroecosystems, Data on the soil and climate from where the material was collected are also included, as are decomposition and nutrient release rates of many of the organic inputs. Examples of uses of ORD are provided in the paper: (1) nutrient contents (including median values and ranges) and other resource quality parameters of farmyard manure and crop residues are compared to that of alternative nutrient sources such as different plant parts and plant types; (2) nutrient stocks found in farm boundary hedges are estimated and evaluated as a source of nutrients for soil fertility management; (3) hypotheses regarding the indices and critical values of N, lignin, and polyphenol contents for predicting N release rates are tested; (4) organic materials for soil fertility management experiments are selected. This database, when coupled with models and decision support tools, will help advance organic matter management for soil fertility improvement from an empirical to a predictive practice.","AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT ","en",2001,"Jan","USA","The Netherlands","10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00267-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0167-8809(00)00267-x","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N mineralization;Lignin;Organic resource quality;Nutrient budgets;Polyphenol","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"An overview of some tillage impacts on earthworm population abundance and diversity - implications for functioning in soils.","K.Y Chan","K.Y Chan","Conflicting reports in the literature on the effects of tillage on earthworms are reviewed in the light of their roles in agroecosystem functioning. Tillage can change the abundance (by 2-9 times) as well as the composition (diversity) of earthworm populations. The actual impact is dependent on soil factors, climatic conditions and the tillage operations but hitherto this information was seldom provided in research reports. The declines in earthworm population often reported in conventionally tilled soils are associated with undesirable changes in the soil environmental conditions resulting from excessive tillage. Different species of earthworm respond differently to tillage. While the abundance of the deep burrowing species (anecic) tends to decline under tillage, particularly under deep ploughing, endogeic species can actually increase in number especially when there is increased food supply. Under conservation tillage systems, earthworms can potentially play a more important role than under conventional tillage in the functioning of the farming systems because of their abilities to modify the soil physical environment and nutrient cycling. However, adoption of conservation tillage does not automatically result in an optimal earthworm population in terms of abundance and diversity. There are opportunities to introduce more beneficial species to improve the ecological performance of agro-ecosystems. More research is needed to fully understand the ecology of different earthworm species, their interactions and their potential roles in promoting more sustainable farming systems.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of warming on ecosystem nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics is not available. Here, we compiled data of 528 observations from 51 papers and carried out a meta-analysis of experimental warming effects on 13 variables related to terrestrial N pools and dynamics. We found that, on average, net N mineralization and net nitrification rate were increased by 52.2 and 32.2%, respectively, under experimental warming treatment. N pools were also increased by warming, although the magnitude of this increase was less than that of N fluxes. Soil microbial N and N immobilization were not changed by warming, probably because microbes are limited by carbon sources. Grassland and shrubland/heathland were less responsive to warming than forest, probably because the reduction of soil moisture by warming offset the temperature effect in these areas. Soil heating cable and all-day treatment appeared to be the most effective method on N cycling among all treatment methods. Results of this meta-analysis are useful for better understanding the response of N cycling to global warming and the underlying mechanism of warming effects on plants and ecosystem functions.","NEW PHYTOLOGIST ","en",2013,"Jul","China","China","10.2307/3060925","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3060925","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","increased temperature;mineralization;N cycling processes;nitrification;nitrogen fluxes","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Earthworm management in tropical agroecosystems.","P.J Bohlen","P.J Bohlen","The first three chapters of the book deal with earthworm taxonomy, community structure and environmental plasticity. A worldwide survey of 151 earthworm species in the humid tropics shows that these species can be divided into four categories based on whether they are native or exotic and have a broad or narrow range of environmental tolerances. This analysis provides an extremely useful framework for categorizing species for management purposes but also has relevance to conservation of rare, native species with limited environmental plasticity. An analysis of the origin and structure of earthworm communities in the tropics reveals that earthworms comprise 40–90% of the macrofaunal biomass in most tropical ecosystems, except for annually cropped systems. Their importance to faunal biomass in tropical forests calls into question the prevailing view that other soil groups, such as ants or termites, are more important than earthworms in organic matter processing and soil turnover in the tropics. As in temperate ecosystems, earthworms account for the bulk of the soil animal biomass, except where they are limited by lack of moisture. Interestingly, native species apparently survive better in managed systems of India and Africa than in Mexico and Central America, possibly due to the greater geographical isolation of Central America relative to the other regions. The chapter on environmental tolerance of earthworms that have extended distribution helps to explain why these species are so successful and suggests that they may have different effects on N mineralization than native endemic species.The next three chapters of the book deal, in turn, with the effects of earthworms on plant production, soil physical properties and organic matter and nutrient dynamics. The chapter on plant production contains perhaps the most extensive analysis of the influence of earthworms on plant growth ever undertaken. Summarizing over 240 results the authors show that most studies report an increase of growth in plant shoots and grain yield in the presence of earthworms and that the greatest increases occur in sandy soils with low organic matter content. This chapter also does an excellent job of summarizing the mechanisms by which earthworms may enhance worm growth, although there remain many uncertainties in this area.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2000,"Jun","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00026-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(00)00026-2","10.1038/srep06365","Various","Various","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm communities in grasslands and horticultural soils.","W. A. M. Didden","W. A. M. Didden","In a survey of 42 farm sites, comprising grassland and two types of horticultural farms (growing vegetables or flower bulbs), earthworm communities were sampled by hand-sorting and a number of soil physicochemical characteristics recorded. For heavy metals the availability in the soil solution was estimated based on the measured absolute content. Abundance, biomass and species richness were significantly higher in grassland soils than in horticultural soils, and within the horticultural farms significantly higher in vegetable than in flower-bulb farms. No epigeic species were found in horticultural soils. The differences between the various farm types were probably related to the intensity of management practices, such as soil tillage, harvesting and crop protection measures, that result in less soil organic matter of lower quality. The data from the grassland farms were analyzed in conjunction with the physico-chemical soil characteristics, applying canonical correspondence analysis. Community parameters such as species richness and diversity apparently were not related to soil characteristics, but an appreciable part of the variation in abundance and biomass of several individual species could be explained by factors such as lutum content (particles < 16 m), pH, bio-availability of metal ions and geographical position of the sample site. It is concluded that repeated surveys of this type may become a valuable tool for monitoring soil quality.","BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS ","en",2001,"Feb","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1007/s003740000297","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003740000297","10.1038/srep06365","The Netherlands","marine clay, sandy soil, The Netherlands","Earthworms;Grassland;Community;Structure;Survey ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"The role of residues management in sustainable agricultural systems.","R. Lal","R. Lal","Crop residues returned to the soil can maintain or enhance soil quality and productivity through favorable effects on soil properties and life-support processes. In the U.S., crop residues produced by 19 principal crops are estimated at 400 million Mg/yr, compared with 2952 million Mg/yr produced in the world. Crop residues returned to the soil contribute to the maintenance of and an increase in soil organic carbon content and add plant nutrients and reduce fertilizer requirements. Total amount of principal nutrients in crop residues range from 40 to 100 Kg/Mg. Consumption of fertilizers in 1991 was 116 million Mg of N, P and K in the world and 16 million Mg in the U.S. In comparison, nutrients (N + P + K) contained in crop residues amount to 9 million Mg/yr in the U.S, and 74 million Mg/yr in the world. Therefore, a considerable quantity of fertilizers can be saved by returning the residues produced to the soil.  Residue management is also important in soil and water conservation. About 2.5 Mg/ha of crop residue applied as mulch can reduce soil loss by 60%. Water conservation is an equally important benefit of returning crop residue, especially for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions. Water stored in the root zone increases with increasing amount of residue returned to the soil. There are also snow retention benefits of crop residue mulch.  Fuel value is estimated at 18.6 x 10(9) J or 2 bbl of oil per Mg of crop residues. Total fuel value is estimated at 7 EJ/yr (1 EJ = Exa Joule = 1 x 10(18) Joules) in the U.S, and 64 EJ/yr in the world. Management of crop residues can also be a useful strategy for sequestering carbon into the soil, and reducing emissions of radiatively-active gases into the atmosphere: About 1.5 Pg (1 Pg = 1 peta gram = 1 x 10(15) g) of carbon Is stored in the crop residues produced annually in the world.  Crop residues influence agricultural sustainability by enhancing productivity. Productivity increases with residue returned are greater with low rates of fertilizers than with high or recommended rates. Generally there is a synergistic effect between residue returned and fertilizer use. Innovative cropping systems should be developed to produce the desired amount of crop residue for alternative uses and returning surplus to the soil. In this regard, cover crops and conservation tillage systems can play an important role in designing appropriate cropping/farming systems.","JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE","en",1995,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1300/j064v05n04_06","http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j064v05n04_06","10.1038/srep06365","USA","Various","Keywords +: CARBON","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Using these metrics for meta-analysis requires knowledge of their statistical properties, but these have not been previously derived. We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis.

"Assessing the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon: A comparison of four meta-analyses.","BRUCE A. HUNGATE","CRAIG W. OSENBERG","Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO2 rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO2, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta‐analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta‐analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO2 on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta‐analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta‐analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO2 on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta‐analysis, suggesting the continued need for long‐term experiments.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","en",2009,"Aug","USA","USA","10.1111/j.1365-2486.20091866.x","https://ecoss.nau.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/HUNGATE_et_al-2009-Global_Change_Biology.pdf","10.1038/srep06365","Various (meta-analysis comparison)","Various","C sequestration;effect size;elevated CO2;meta-analysis;soil C;statistical power ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Meta-regression analysis can control statistically for factual heterogeneity, methodological diversity, and possible biases among the primary studies. In the context of benefit transfers, meta-analysis can produce reduced-form functions that identify and test systematic influences of study, economic, and resource attributes on willingness to pay and other environmental valuations. This chapter provides an introduction to basic statistical methods employed in meta-analysis, including weighted-averages and meta-regressions. The chapter identifies and discusses solutions to several econometric problems commonly associated with metadata, including heterogeneity, heteroskedasticity, correlated effects, and publication bias. Basic statistical concepts and methods are illustrated using a sample of estimates for the value of a statistical life, including within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Benefit-transfer errors are assessed using several alternative statistical measures.","BENEFIT TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE VALUES: A GUIDE FOR RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS","en",2015,"N/A","USA","USA","10.1007/978-94-017-9930-0_15","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9930-0_15","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","Meta-analysis;Meta-regression analysis;Benefit transfer;Environmental valuation functions;Benefit-transfer errors;Publication bias;Value of a statistical life ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"A meta-analysis of elevated CO2 effects on woody plant mass, form and physiology.","Peter S. Curtis","Xianzhong Wang","Quantitative integration of the literature on the effect of elevated CO2 on woody plants is important to aid our understanding of forest health in coming decades and to better predict terrestrial feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (WT) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of WT by half, from + 31 % under optimal conditions to + 16 %, while low light increased the response to + 52 %. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+ 19 %) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+ 54 %). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots < 0.51 (- 36 %) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 (- 18 % and - 16 % respectively, data expressed on a leaf mass basis), while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust, statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO2 effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization.","OECOLOGIA ","en",1998,"Feb","USA","USA","10.1007/s004420050381","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050381","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","elevated CO2;meta-analysis;woody plants ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"The file drawer problem and tolerance for null results.","Robert Rosenthal","Robert Rosenthal","For any given research area, one cannot tell how many studies have been conducted but never reported. The extreme view of the ""file drawer problem"" is that journals are filled with the 5% of the studies that show Type I errors, while the file drawers are filled with the 95% of the studies that show nonsignificant results. Quantitative procedures for computing the tolerance for filed and future null results are reported and illustrated, and the implications are discussed.","PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN ","en",1979,"May","USA","USA","10.1037//0033-2909.86.3.638","http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0033-2909.86.3.638","10.1038/srep06365","Various","Various","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Metawin: Statistical Software for Meta-Analysis, Version 2.","Michael S. Rosenberg ","Jessica Gurevitch","MetaWin first published in 1997, allows the user to easily carry out all common meta-analysis calculations on independent studies from a wide variety of disciplines, including medicine, ecology, and the social sciences, compare mean effect sizes and confidence limits of different classes of studies with the click of a mouse, and examine the results of within- and between-group heterogeneity using parametric methods as well as resampling tests. The program allows users to refine their analyses by choosing which specific groups and individual studies from their data sets they wish to analyze or eliminate. MetaWin was written in Pascal and compiled for Windows. It is temporarily unavailable.","Software","en",1997,"N/A","USA","USA","10.1086/420179","https://doi.org/10.1086/420179","10.1038/srep06365","N/A","N/A","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
