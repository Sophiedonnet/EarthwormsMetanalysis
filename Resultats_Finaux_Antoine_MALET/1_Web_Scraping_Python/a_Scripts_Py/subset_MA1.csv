"Soil chemistry turned upside down: a meta-analysis of invasive earthworm effects on soil chemical properties","Olga Ferlian","Nico Eisenhauer","Recent studies have shown that invasive earthworms can dramatically reduce native biodiversity, both above and below the ground. However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta‐analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base‐rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapotranspiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta‐analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, for example, shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta‐analyses.","Ecology (Ecological Society of Amercica)","en",2020,"Aug","Germany","Germany","10.1002/ecy.2936","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2936","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Various","ammonium;earthworm ecological group;element flux;exotic earthworms;nitrate;nitrification;nitrogen;nutrient cycling;pH;phosphorus;soil carbon;water content ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effect of earthworm addition on soil nitrogen availability, microbial biomass and litter decomposition in mesocosms.","Yelinda Araujo","Eleusa Barros","The aim of the study was to determine the effect of adding two tropical earthworm species, Rhinodrilus contortus and Pontoscolex corethrurus, to mesocosms on the availability of mineral N (NH4 + and NO3 − concentrations), soil microbial biomass (bio-N), and the decomposition rates of three contrasting leaf litter species, in a glasshouse experiment. The mesocosms were filled with forest soil and covered with a layer of leaf litter differing in nutritional quality: (1) Hevea brasiliensis (C/N=27); (2) Carapa guianensis (C/N=32); (3) Vismia sp., the dominant tree species in the second growth forest (control, C/N= 42); and, (4) a mixture of the former three leaf species, in equal proportions (C/N=34). At the end of the 97-day experiment, the soil mineral N concentrations, bio-N, and leaf litter weight loss were determined. Both earthworm species showed significant effects on the concentrations of soil NO3 − (p0.01) and NH4 + (p0.05). Bio-N was always greater in the mesocosms with earthworms (especially with R. contortus) and in the mesocosms with leaf litter of H. brasiliensis (6 µg N g−1 soil), the faster decomposing species, than in the other treatments (0.1–1.6 µg N g−1). Thus, earthworm activity increased soil mineral-N concentrations, possibly due to the consumption of soil microbial biomass, which can speed turnover and mineralization of microbial tissues. No significant differences in decomposition rate were found between the mesocosms with and without earthworms, suggesting that experiments lasting longer are needed to determine the effect of earthworms on litter decomposition rates.","Biology and fertility of soils ","en",2003,"Jan","Venezuela","Brazil","10.1007/s00374-003-0696-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-003-0696-0  ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Brazil","Amazonia","Earthworms;Nitrogen mineralization;Litter decomposition process;Amazonia","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"A review of earthworm impact on soil function and ecosystem services.","M. Blouin","J.‐J. Brun","Biodiversity is responsible for the provision of many ecosystem services; human well‐being is based on these services, and consequently on biodiversity. In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed ‘ecosystem engineers’. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate.

"Ecosystem consequences of exotic earthworm invasion of north temperate forests.","Patrick J. Bohlen","Robert T. Fahey","The invasion of north temperate forests by exotic species of earthworms is an important issue that has been overlooked in the study and management of these forests. We initiated research to address the hypothesis that earthworm invasion will have large consequences for nutrient retention and uptake in these ecosystems. In this special feature of Ecosystems, we present five papers describing results from our experiment. In this paper, we (a) introduce our experimental approach and conceptual model of how earthworms influence forest ecosystem processes, (b) describe the characteristics of the study areas and earthworm communities at our two study locations, and (c) provide a brief overview and synthesis of the main findings. The most dramatic effect of earthworm invasion was the loss of the forest floor at an undisturbed forest site, which altered the location and nature of nutrient cycling activity in the soil profile. Invasion changed soil total carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) pools, carbon–nitrogen (C:N) ratios, the loss and distribution of different soil P fractions, and the distribution and function of roots and microbes. Response to invasion varied with site characteristics and earthworm species. Our results suggest that exotic earthworm invasion is a significant factor that will influence the structure and function of northern temperate forest ecosystems over the next few decades. Regional evaluations of these forests will need to consider the presence or absence of earthworms along with other important ecosystem drivers, such as pollution, climate, and underlying soil characteristics.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0126-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0126-z","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York state","exotic species;invasions;carbon;nitrogen;phosphorus;roots;nutrient cycling;forest","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Non-native invasive earthworms as agents of change in northern temperate forests.","Patrick J. Bohlen","D. Parkinson","Exotic earthworms from Europe and Asia are invading many northern forests in North America that currently lack native earthworms, providing an opportunity to assess the role of this important group of invertebrates in forest ecosystems. Research on earthworm invasions has focused on changes in soil structure and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling that occur following invasion. These changes include the mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons, decreases in soil C storage, and equivocal effects on N cycling. Less well studied are changes in the soil foodwebs that accompany earthworm invasion. Soils of north temperate forests harbor a tremendous diversity of microorganisms and invertebrates, whose distribution and abundance can be substantially altered by earthworm invasion. Furthermore, invasive earthworms can affect understory plant communities, raising concerns over the loss of rare native herbs in some areas. The ecological consequences of earthworm invasion are mediated through physical, geochemical, and biological effects. These effects vary with different earthworm species, as well as with the characteristics of the site being invaded. Earthworm invasions may have important interactions with other rapid changes predicted for northern forests in the coming decades, including climate and land-use change, increased nutrient deposition, and other biological invasions.","Frontiers in Ecology and Environnement","en",2004,"Oct","USA","Belgium","10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0427:NIEAAO]2.0.CO;2","https://doi.org/10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0427:NIEAAO]2.0.CO;2","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Northern forests, North America.","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Protection of soil carbon by microaggregates within earthworm casts.","Heleen Bossuyt","Paul F. Hendrix","Earthworms are known to play a role in aggregate formation and soil organic matter (SOM) protection. However, it is still unclear at what scale and how quickly earthworms manage to protect SOM. We investigated the effects of Aporrectodea caliginosa on aggregation and aggregate-associated C pools using 13C-labeled sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) leaf residue. Two incubations were set up. The first incubation consisted of soil samples crushed &lt;250 μm to break up all macroaggregates with three treatments: (i) control soil; (ii) soil+13C-labeled residue and (iii) soil+13C-labeled residue+earthworms. Earthworms were added after 8 d and 12 d (days) later, aggregate size distribution was measured together with total C and 13C in each aggregate fraction. A second incubation was made to assay protected versus unprotected total C and 13C from 21-d laboratory incubations of intact and crushed large (&gt;2000 μm) and small (250–2000 μm) macroaggregates and microaggregates (53–250 μm). Eight different pools of aggregate-associated C were quantified: (1) and (2) unprotected C pools in large and small macroaggregates, (3) unprotected C pools in microaggregates, (4) and (5) protected C pools in large and small macroaggregates, (6) protected C pool in microaggregates, and (7) and (8) protected C pools in microaggregates within large and small macroaggregates. In the presence of earthworms, a higher proportion of large macroaggregates was newly formed and these aggregates contained more C and 13C compared to bulk soil. There were no significant differences between the samples with or without earthworms in the C pool-sizes protected by macroaggregates, microaggregates or microaggregates within small macroaggregates. However, in the presence of earthworms, the C protected by microaggregates within large macroaggregates was a significant pool and 22% of this C pool was newly added C. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the direct involvement of earthworms in providing protection of soil C in microaggregates within large macroaggregates leading to a possible long-term stabilization of soil C.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2005,"Feb","Belgium","Georgia","10.1016/j.soilbio.2004735"," https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2004.07.035 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Greece","Horseshoe Bend, near Athens","Aggregation;Microaggregates;Carbon;Earthworms;Carbon protection","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Strategies lombriciennes","M. B. Bouché","M. B. Bouché","An earthworm classification in ecological categories based on morphological features (organs showing functional adaptations) on spatial distribution, on soil humidity and on feeding habits was introduced in 1969 for didactic reasons. Subsequently, this classification has proved to be a powerful tool of ecological synthesis. It distinguishes three extreme types of adaptative evolution (endogeous forms, epigeous forms, anecics); their definitions are completed. They are three poles between which earthworms could be put in order. According to the past (which involves some evolutionary ways), and the level of adaptation into a site (new or old settelments) there is congruence between earthworm features (feeding habits, reproduction, extreme factor resistances, mobility, size, respiration, demography, behaviour, predator pressures, etc.) and their environment (available niches, food, humidity, etc.). Ecological categories are the traduction of evolutionary earthworm strategies and all bioecological features. The morpho-functional interpretation, always feasible, and some ecological, biological, physiological measurements made in favorable circumstances validate this classification. This holistic classification provides the opportunity to judge the relative adaptation of a monospecific local population to its environment. Among such adaptations a new making of resistance of earthworms is described: the ""enkystment"" by cocoons.","Ecological Bulletins","fr",1977,"N/A","France","France","10.1016/0012-8252(87)90008-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-8252(87)90008-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","France","France","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"How do earthworms affect microfloral and faunal community diversity?","George G. Brown","George G. Brown","Much of the work regarding earthworm effects on other organisms has focused on the functional significance of microbial-earthworm interactions, and little is known on the effects of earthworms on microfloral and faunal diversity. Earthworms can affect soil microflora and fauna populations directly and indirectly by three main mechanisms: (1) comminution, burrowing and casting; (2) grazing; (3) dispersal. These activities change the soil's physico-chemical and biological status and may cause drastic shifts in the density, diversity, structure and activity of microbial and faunal communities within the drilosphere. Certain organisms and species may be enhanced, reduced or not be affected at all depending on their ability to adapt to the particular conditions of different earthworm drilospheres. A large host of factors (including CaCO3, enzymes, mucus and antimicrobial substances) influence the ability of preferentially or randomly ingested organisms to survive (or not) passage through the earthworm gut, and their resultant capacity to recover and proliferate (or not) in earthworm casts. Small organisms, particularly microflora and microfauna, with limited ability to move within the soil, may benefit from the (comparatively) long ranging movements of earthworms. Microflora and smaller fauna appear to be particularly sensitive to earthworm activities, and priming effects enhancing nutrient release, particularly in casts, are common. Larger fauna such as microarthropods, enchytraeids and Isopods may be enhanced under some conditions (e.g., in earthworm middens), but in other cases earthworm activity may lead to a decrease in their populations due to competition for food (microbes and organic materials), and spatial and temporal changes in food abundance. Nevertheless, considering the presently available data, the beneficial interactions of earthworms and microflora and fauna appear to far outweigh the potential negative effects. However, much is still unknown regarding the interactions of earthworms of different ecological categories on the diversity and function of microfloral and faunal communities, and much more interdisciplinary research is needed to assess the potential role of earthworms in regulating the diversity of microflora and fauna in soil systems and the potentially beneficial or harmful effects this regulation may have on ecosystem function and plant growth in different ecosystems.","Plant and soil ","en",1995,"Jan","Brazil ","Brazil ","10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, E LANSING, MI","diversity;earthworms;soil fauna;soil microflora;soil processes","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Carbon and nitrogen mobilisation by earthworms of different functional groups as affected by soil sand content.","O. Butenschoen","S. Scheu","Earthworms play an important role in organic matter processing and nutrient cycling in temperate ecosystems. It is known that earthworms preferentially ingest sand grains mixed with organic material and it has been suggested that the mixture of sand and organic material during the gut passage may play an important role in litter degradation and nutrient release, which may accelerate assimilation of nutrients by earthworms and likely enhance plant growth. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated the effect of the anecic earthworm species emLumbricus terrestris and the endogeic earthworm species emOctolasion tyrtaeum separately and in combination on carbon and nitrogen mobilisation from surface applied rye litter labelled with 13 and 15. By mixing arable soil with 25% sand, we investigated the effect of the availability of sand. To quantify the mobilisation of 15N, three rye seedlings were planted in each microcosm and analysed for isotope signature after 3 months of incubation. Mobilisation of 13C was quantified by analysing the incorporation of label into the soil and earthworm tissue.Irrespective of the addition of sand the biomass of emL. terrestris decreased during the experiment, whereas that of emO. tyrtaeum increased in single species treatment and slightly decreased in the combined treatment with emL. terrestris. The concentration of 13C decreased while that of 15N increased in the tissue of both earthworm species, with the effect being more pronounced in emL. terrestris for 13C and in emO. tyrtaeum for 15N. Both earthworm species increased shoot biomass, with the effect of emL. terrestris (+80%) exceeding that of emO. tyrtaeum (+28%) and maximum plant biomass in the combined treatment (+92%). Earthworms did not affect the 15N concentration of rye plants, but sand significantly increased 15N concentration of plants, presumably due to improving soil structure. Overall, the incorporation of 13C into the soil was low and was significantly increased in presence of sand, with the highest enrichment in treatments without earthworms.The results indicate that the availability of sand does not increase effects of earthworms on litter degradation, nutrient release and plant growth. Rather, independent of soil sand content earthworms increase plant growth, whereas the presence of sand itself enhances the uptake of nitrogen from plant litter and the incorporation of litter carbon into the soil.","Pedobiologia","en",2009,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.1101","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.11.001","10.1002/ecy.2936","Germany","Bad Lauchstädt","Stable isotopes;Soil organic matter;N-mobilisation;Lumbricidae ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Burrow systems of endogeic earthworms: Effects of earthworm abundance and consequences for soil water infiltration.","Yvan Capowiez","Eric Michel","By creating burrows, earthworms influence the transfer properties of soils. The effects of endogeic species on soil transfer properties, however, are not yet well understood because these earthworms generally create burrows that are refilled by casts and have no preferential vertical orientation. Thirty soil cores were incubated for various periods (1-3 or 4 weeks) at different earthworm densities (70, 210,345 or 480 individuals m(-2)). The cores were then scanned using X-ray tomography and the burrow systems were characterised by measuring the total burrow volume, bioturbation volume (refilled burrows and lateral compaction around the burrows), the number of branches, tortuosity and continuity (assessed by computing the number of burrows with a vertical extension greater than 15, 20 and 25% of the core). We also computed the mean geodesic distance, i.e. the mean distance from the bottom to the top of the core assuming that distances inside burrows are null. Rainfall simulations were carried out on 17 cores chosen to encompass the variations observed in the burrow systems. The water transfer efficiency of each core was estimated by measuring two parameters: breakthrough volume and the percentage of water transmitted after 1 h of rain. Burrow and bioturbation volume increased significantly and steadily with time and earthworm density. We estimated that on average Allolobophora chlororica burrowed 22 cm per week. All other burrow system characteristics also increased with time and earthworm density except the mean geodesic distance, which decreased significantly. This suggests that intraspecific interactions had no significant effect on burrow system geometry. Univariate PLS regressions were used to understand which burrow system characteristics had the strongest influence on water transfer. These regressions showed that the mean geodesic distance was the most important parameter. This means that in addition to individual burrow characteristics, the spatial arrangement of the whole burrow system also had a major effect on transfer properties.

"Non-native earthworms in riparian soils increase nitrogen flux into adjacent aquatic ecosystems.","David M. Costello","Gary A. Lamberti","Riparian zones are an important transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and they function in nutrient cycling and removal. Non-native earthworms invading earthworm-free areas of North America can affect nutrient cycling in upland soils and have the potential to affect it in riparian soils. We examined how the presence of earthworms can affect riparian nutrient cycling and nutrient delivery to streams. Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to determine how (1) the biomass of earthworms and (2) earthworm species can affect nutrient flux from riparian zones to nearby streams and how this flux can affect streamwater nutrients and periphyton growth. In separate experiments, riparian soil cores were amended with one of four mixed earthworm biomasses (0, 4, 10, or 23 g m⁻² ash-free dry mass) or with one of three earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Lumbricus terrestris, L. rubellus) or no earthworm species. Riparian soil cores were coupled to artificial streams, and over a 36-day period, we measured nutrient leaching rates, in-stream nutrient concentrations, and periphyton growth. Ammonium leaching increased with increasing biomass and was greatest from the A. caliginosa treatments. Nitrate leaching increased through time and increased at a greater rate with higher biomass and from cores containing A. caliginosa. We suggest that the overall response of increased nitrate leaching [90% of total nitrogen (N)] was due to a combination of ammonium excretion and burrowing by earthworms, which increased nitrification rates. During both experiments, periphyton biomass increased through time but did not differ across treatments despite high in-stream inorganic N. Through time, in-stream phosphorus (P) concentration declined to &lt;5 µg l⁻¹, and periphyton growth was likely P-limited. We conclude that activities of non-native earthworms (particularly A. caliginosa) can alter biogeochemical cycling in riparian zones, potentially reducing the N-buffering capacity of riparian zones and altering stoichiometric relationships in adjacent aquatic ecosystems.","OECOLOGIA","en",2008,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-008-1149-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1149-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Upper Peninsula of Michigan","Invasive species;Lumbricidae;Nitrate;Nitrification;Stream productivity ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Invasion of exotic earthworms into ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms.","P. F. Hendrix","X. Zou","The most conspicuous biological invasions in terrestrial ecosystems have been by exotic plants, insects and vertebrates. Invasions by exotic earthworms, although not as well studied, may be increasing with global commerce in agriculture, waste management and bioremediation. A number of cases has documented where invasive earthworms have caused significant changes in soil profiles, nutrient and organic matter dynamics, other soil organisms or plant communities. Most of these cases are in areas that have been disturbed (e.g., agricultural systems) or were previously devoid of earthworms (e.g., north of Pleistocene glacial margins). It is not clear that such effects are common in ecosystems inhabited by native earthworms, especially where soils are undisturbed. We explore the idea that indigenous earthworm fauna and/or characteristics of their native habitats may resist invasion by exotic earthworms and thereby reduce the impact of exotic species on soil processes. We review data and case studies from temperate and tropical regions to test this idea. Specifically, we address the following questions: Is disturbance a prerequisite to invasion by exotic earthworms? What are the mechanisms by which exotic earthworms may succeed or fail to invade habitats occupied by native earthworms? Potential mechanisms could include (1) intensity of propagule pressure (how frequently and at what densities have exotic species been introduced and has there been adequate time for proliferation?); (2) degree of habitat matching (once introduced, are exotic species faced with unsuitable habitat conditions, unavailable resources, or unsuited feeding strategies?); and (3) degree of biotic resistance (after introduction into an otherwise suitable habitat, are exotic species exposed to biological barriers such as predation or parasitism, ‘‘unfamiliar’’ microflora, or competition by resident native species?). Once established, do exotic species coexist with native species, or are the natives eventually excluded? Do exotic species impact soil processes differently in the presence or absence of native species? We conclude that (1) exotic earthworms do invade ecosystems inhabited by indigenous earthworms, even in the absence of obvious disturbance; (2) competitive exclusion of native earthworms by exotic earthworms is not easily demonstrated and, in fact, co-existence of native and exotic species appears to be common, even if transient; and (3) resistance to exotic earthworm invasions, if it occurs, may be more a function of physical and chemical characteristics of a habitat than of biological interactions between native and exotic earthworms.

The global distribution of a few species (e.g., Pontoscolex corethrurus) was noted by early naturalists, but now approximately 120 such peregrine species are recognized to be widespread from regional to global scales, mainly via human activities. Species adapted to human transport and to colonization of disturbed habitats are most widespread and are the principal invasive species. We identify a number of endogenous and exogenous factors that may contribute to the successful establishment and spread of peregrine species. Quantification of these factors may help to determine why certain species become invasive while others do not.

Here, we relate rates of gross N mineralisation to fungi-to-bacteria ratios in three natural forest types of contrasting N availability and in a long-term N-loading experiment in a boreal forest. We report, for the first time, a strong negative correlation between gross N mineralisation and the fungi-to-bacteria ratio ( R²adj= 0.91, P = 0.0005, N = 7). There was also a negative correlation between gross N mineralisation and the C-to-N ratio (R²adj = 0.89, P = 0.001, N = 7), but a weaker positive correlation between gross N mineralisation and soil pH ( R²adj= 0.64, P = 0.019, N = 7).

"Influence of invasive earthworms on above and belowground vegetation in a northern hardwood forest.","Kristine N. Hopfensperger","Timothy J. Fahey","Scientists are beginning to have a firm grasp on the dramatic influence invasive earthworms can have on nutrient cycling in northern hardwood forests, yet a concrete understanding of their effects on plant communities is still needed. Towards this effort, we examined both the above and belowground plant communities, along with soil organic matter, pH, texture and light in Arnot Forest located in south central New York. Two transects were aligned parallel to previously defined gradients of earthworm density and were sampled in the spring and summer of 2008. We found plots codominated by multiple earthworm species decreased belowground seed abundance and species richness. Aboveground plant cover and diversity along with soil organic matter was lower along the transect with multiple earthworm species. In addition, we found earthworm density increased with soil pH, but did not detect relationships with soil texture or light intensity. Our results were consistent with previous findings of earthworms negatively affecting aboveground plant communities and soil organic matter, and increasing pH. Our study demonstrates the potential for exotic earthworms to dramatically alter forest soil seed banks; however, future research is needed to investigate complexities of earthworm community dynamics (e.g., number and life form of earthworm species) and to tease apart mechanisms responsible for changes in the belowground plant community.","AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST","en",2011,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1674/0003-0031-166.1.53","http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-166.1.53","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Arnot forest, New York","SEED-BANK;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;STANDING VEGETATION;SOIL;TEMPERATE;COLONIZATION;CONSEQUENCES;MORPHOLOGY;DYNAMICS;PATTERNS (keywords+)","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Publication and related biases.","Michael D. Jennions","Hannah R. Rothstein","This chapter discusses the increased occurrence of publication bias in the scientific literature. Publication bias is associated with the inaccurate representation of the merit of a hypothesis or idea. A strict definition is that it occurs when the published literature reports results that systematically differ from those of all studies and statistical tests conducted; the result is that false conclusions are drawn. The chapter presents five main approaches used to either detect potential narrow sense publication bias or assess how sensitive the results of a meta-analysis are to the possible exclusion. These include funnel plots, tests for relationships between effect size and sample size using nonparametric correlation or regression, trim and fill method, fail-safe numbers, and model selection.","Individual book","en",2013,"Apr","Australia","USA","10.23943/princeton/978069113728503014","https://asu.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/publication-and-related-biases","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","N/A","General Mathematics","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Resource stoichiometry and availability modulate species richness and biomass of tropical litter macro-invertebrates.","Malte Jochum","Ulrich Brose","High biodiversity and biomass of soil communities are crucial for litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical forests. However, the leaf litter that these communities consume is of particularly poor quality as indicated by elemental stoichiometry. The impact of resource quantity, quality and other habitat parameters on species richness and biomass of consumer communities is often studied in isolation, although much can be learned from simultaneously studying both community characteristics.Using a dataset of 780 macro‐invertebrate consumer species across 32 sites in tropical lowland rain forest and agricultural systems on Sumatra, Indonesia, we investigated the effects of basal resource stoichiometry (C:X ratios of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S in local leaf litter), litter mass (basal resource quantity and habitat space), plant species richness (surrogate for litter habitat heterogeneity), and soil pH (acidity) on consumer species richness and biomass across different consumer groups (i.e. 3 feeding guilds and 10 selected taxonomic groups).In order to distinguish the most important predictors of consumer species richness and biomass, we applied a standardised model averaging approach investigating the effects of basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and soil pH on both consumer community characteristics. This standardised approach enabled us to identify differences and similarities in the magnitude and importance of such effects on consumer species richness and biomass.Across consumer groups, we found litter mass to be the most important predictor of both species richness and biomass. Resource stoichiometry had a more pronounced impact on consumer species richness than on their biomass. As expected, taxonomic groups differed in which resource and habitat parameters (basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and pH) were most important for modulating their community characteristics.The importance of litter mass for both species richness and biomass indicates that these tropical consumers strongly depend on habitat space and resource availability. Our study supports previous theoretical work indicating that consumer species richness is jointly influenced by resource availability and the balanced supply of multiple chemical elements in their resources.","Journal of animal ecology","en",2017,"Sep","Germany","Germany","10.1111/1365-2656.12695","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12695","10.1002/ecy.2936","Indonesia ","Sumatra","consumer biomass;consumer species richnes;sconsumer-resource interaction;ecological stoichiometry;elemental ratios;model averaging ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Biogeochemistry and the structure of tropical brown food webs.","Michael Kaspari","Stephen P. Yanoviak","Litter invertebrates are notoriously patchy at small scales. Here we show that the abundance of 10 litter taxa also varies 100‐fold at landscape and regional scales across 26 forest stands in Peru and Panama. We contrast three hypotheses that link gradients of abundance to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Of 14 factors considered (12 chemical elements, plus fiber and litter depth), four best predicted the abundance of litter invertebrates. In the Secondary Productivity Hypothesis, phosphorus limits abundance via the conversion of detritus to microbial biomass. Two of four microbivore taxa, collembola and isopods, increased with the percentage of P (%P) of decomposing litter. However, percentage of S (correlated with %P) best predicted the abundance of collembola, oribatids, and diplopods (2= 0.38, 0.33, 0.21, respectively). In the Structural Elements Hypotheses, N and Ca limit the abundance of silk‐spinning and calcareous taxa, respectively. Mesostigmatids, pseudoscorpions, and spiders, all known to make silk, each increased with percentage of N of litter (2= 0.22, 0.31, 0.26, respectively). Calcareous isopods, but not diplopods, increased with percentage of Ca of litter (2= 0.59). In the Ecosystem Size Hypothesis, top predators are limited by available space. The abundance of the three remaining predators, chilopods, staphylinids, and ants, increased with litter depth (2= 0.31, 0.74, 0.69, respectively), and food webs from forests with deeper litter supported a higher ratio of predators to microbivores. These results suggest that biogeochemical gradients can provide a mechanism, through stoichiometry and trophic theory, shaping the geography of community structure.","Ecology ","en",2009,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1890/08-1795.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1795.1","10.1002/ecy.2936","Panama / Peru","Forests / Loreto province (Peru)","calcium decomposition;ecosystem size;invertebrates;litter;nitrogen;phosphorus;stoichiometry;trophic structure;tropical forests ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effect of the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea tuberculata on aggregation and carbon redistribution in uninvaded forest soil columns.","Meghan E. Knowles","Josef H. Görres","The long-term impact of earthworm presence on soil carbon (C) dynamics of previously uninhabited northeastern forests is still largely unknown. Currently, earthworm presence is understood to both enhance soil respiration and create stable microaggregates, processes assumed to have conflicting effects on long term C storage. To date, studies investigating earthworm-created microaggregates and occluded C have rarely been done in undisturbed forest soils. A paired mesocosm study (n = 5) was conducted investigating the impact of the endogeic earthworm species Aporrectodea tuberculata on the physical proportion of microaggregates and the associated mineral soil C of a minimally disturbed forest soil. Pairs analyzed after 4 weeks of incubation demonstrated no significant aggregate effects. At 4 months, paired cores with earthworms (WW) showed a 67% increase in large macroaggregates (2000 μm diameter, lgMA), compared to cores without earthworms (NW). While distribution shifted among various microaggregate pools (free and occluded within macroaggregates), the net proportion of microaggregates in the soil (dry weight basis) was unaltered. After 4 months, the mineral soil of WW cores had an average of 60% more C than the NW cores due to the relocation of the forest floor. The C associated with the microaggregate fractions increased an average of 56%. Of this increase in C, 95% was accounted for by the microaggregates occluded within the lgMA fraction, a fraction that was almost 4 times greater in the WW cores. Over 50% of the C relocated into the mineral soil was associated with the physically protected microaggregate fractions, indicating that though this species of earthworm did not alter the proportion of microaggregates in these soils, they occluded a substantial proportion of C within those physical fractions. In this particular forest soil, the actions of Aporrectodea tuberculata increased the physically protected C pool through microaggregate restructuring and C enrichment.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2016,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.soilbio.2016616","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.06.016","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Bristol ","Earthworms;Carbon dynamics;Soil aggregation;Microaggregates;Forest soil ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Uses and misuses of meta-analysis in plant ecology.","Julia Koricheva","Jessica Gurevitch","The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.","Journal of Ecology","en",2014,"Jul","UK","USA","10.1111/1365-2745.12224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12224","10.1002/ecy.2936","Not relevant (322 meta-analyses)","Not relevant (322 meta-analyses)","ecophysiology;meta-analysis;methodological quality;plant ecology;research synthesis;systematic review;vote counting ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

We compared mycorrhizal associations of areas of earthworm invasion with those of reference (no-worm) areas in Arnot Forest, central New York, USA.;•; The organic horizon in reference areas had higher mycorrhizal colonization rates and higher colonized root length than did surface layers in areas with active earthworm populations. Hyphal coils were more abundant and also formed a greater proportion of total fungal colonization in reference plots. Vesicles were more abundant and were a higher contribution to total colonization in earthworm plots, indicating a possible stress response to the presence of earthworms.;•; By affecting mycorrhizal colonization and morphology, earthworms may influence nutrient uptake capacity of dominant forest species.

"Greenhouse-gas emissions from soils increased by earthworms.","Ingrid M. Lubbers","J.W.

They are thought to stimulate carbon sequestration in soil aggregates, but also to increase emissions of the main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Hence, it remains highly controversial whether earthworms predominantly affect soils to act as a net source or sink of greenhouse gases. Here, we provide a quantitative review of the overall effect of earthworms on the soil greenhouse-gas balance.

Martin","This study aimed to establish the effects of iMillsonia anomala/i, a tropical geophagous earthworm common in the humid savannas of Lamto (Ivory Coast), on soil organic matter dynamics over different time scales under laboratory conditions. The texture of casts produced by the worms fed on a shrub savanna soil was not significantly different from that of the soil, which showed that iM. anomala/i ingested soil particles without selection. Physical fractionation of soil organic matter showed that the coarse organic fraction (250–2000 μm) was depleted by 25–30% in fresh casts compared to the control noningested soil; this was mainly due to a fragmentation of coarse organic debris. Incubation of casts and a 2-mm sieved control soil under laboratory conditions for more than 1 year showed that the C mineralisation rate was almost four times lower in the casts (3% year-1) than in the control soil (11% year-1). We therefore concluded that on a long time scale iM. anomala/i populations may significantly reduce the decomposition rate of soil organic matter in Lamto savannas.","Biology and fertility of soils ","en",1991,"June","France","France","10.1007/bf00335774","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00335774","10.1002/ecy.2936","Ivory Coast","Lamto ","Geophagous tropical earthworm;Soil organic matter;Assimilation;Physical fractionation;Dynamics of organic matter;Tropical savannas;Millsonia anomala ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Here we present three simple  models of interspecific competitive interactions in communities  containing various numbers of randomly chosen species. All three models  predict that, on average, productivity increases asymptotically with  the original biodiversity of a community. The two models that address  plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models.

"Microbial respiration, biomass, biovolume and nutrient status in burrow walls of Lumbricus terrestris L. (Lumbricidae).","Alexei V. Tiunov","Stefan Scheu","Chemical characteristics and microbial activity were studied in burrow walls of the anecic earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris and in control soil of a lime (Tilia cordata), oak (Quercus robur) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) forest. Samples were taken in June and October at distances of 0–4 (drilosphere), 8–12 and 50–60 (control soil) mm from earthworm burrows. The following variables were measured: organic C, total N, moisture, pH, basal respiration, microbial biomass (SIR method), fungal and bacterial volume (epifluorescence microscopy) and nutrient (C, N and P) limitation of microbial growth. Organic C and total N contents increased in the burrow walls by factors of 1.8–3.5 and 1.3–2.2, respectively, compared to the control soil. The moisture content and pH (up to 1.2 units) was higher. Basal respiration, microbial biomass and bacterial volume in the drilosphere exceeded those in control soil significantly by factors of 3.7–9.1, 2.3–4.7 and 2.1–5.4, respectively. Changes in fungal volume with vicinity to burrows differed between forest sites. Fungal volume was increased significantly by factors of 1.9–3.4 in the earthworm burrow walls in the oak and beech forest, but was similar to that in control soil in the lime forest. Microbial growth in the control soil was limited by N in the oak forest and by N and P in the lime and beech forest. The nutrient status of the microflora changed little in vicinity to burrows. However, microbial N and P demand in earthworm burrow walls exceeded that in soil. The specific respiration (qO2) was increased and the growth response to nutrient additions was faster in the burrow walls suggesting that the microbial community in the burrow walls contains a larger fraction of metabolically-active microorganisms, adapted to continuous resource additions by earthworm faeces and mucus. Enrichment in organic matter, but also other mechanisms, particularly the activity of microbivorous soil animals, are presumably responsible for the formation of a specific microbial community in earthworm burrow walls. It is concluded that L. terrestris burrow walls are stable microhabitats which sustain a large and active microbial community and are likely to play an important role in the soil system by regulating microbial-mediated chemical processes.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",1999,"Dec","Russia","Germany","10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00127-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00127-3","10.1002/ecy.2936","Russia / Germany","Moscou / Göttingen","Earthworms;drilosphere;microorganisms;substrate induced respiration;limitation;nitrogen;phosphorus;forest ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Tiunov","Stefan Scheu","Anecic earthworms emLumbricus terrestris L. were kept in laboratory microcosms containing soil and litter from a lime (emTilia cordata) and beech (emFagus sylvatica) forest. Nutrient (mineral nitrogen and phosphorus) contents, microbial activity and densities of protozoa and nematodes were determined in burrow walls and control soils after 165 days. Well-developed burrow linings consisting of earthworm faeces were formed in the “emTilia” treatment, but not in the “emFagus” treatment, presumably because beech litter was not an adequate food resource for emL. terrestris. Consequently, increases in microbial biomass, basal respiration and microbial volume in burrow walls compared to surrounding soil were significant in the “emTilia” treatment only. However, in both treatments burrow walls were strongly enriched in mineral nitrogen and phosphorus. The density and biomass of protozoa were significantly greater in burrow walls compared to the control soil. The numbers of naked amoebae increased by similar factors of 4 and 3.5 in burrow walls of the “emTilia” and “emFagus” treatment, respectively. Flagellate density increased more than tenfold in burrow walls of the “emTilia” treatment but only twofold in the “emFagus” treatment. In addition, a comparatively large ciliate population was present in burrow walls in the “emTilia” treatment. The total abundance of protozoa was significantly correlated with the contents of inorganic N and P in the samples (emr = 0.68 and 0.63 respectively, P&lt; 0.03) suggesting that protozoan grazing participated in the mobilisation of nutrients from microbial biomass. The total nematode density was increased in burrow walls by a factor of 3 in the “emTilia” treatment (mostly due to bacterivorous nematodes), but was not affected in the “emFagus” treatment. In both treatments density of fungivorous nematodes increased, while that of plant parasites decreased in burrow walls compared to the control soil.

"The unseen invaders: introduced earthworms as drivers of change in plant communities in North American forests (a meta-analysis).","Dylan Craven","Nico Eisenhauer","Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning. While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests.

"Factors affecting earthworm abundance in soils.","C. A. Edwards","C. A.

However, within particular climatic zones, earthworm assemblages, with fairly characteristic species richness, composition, abundance, and biomass, can often be recognized in broadly different habitat types, such as coniferous forests, deciduous woodland, grassland, and arable land. There is a considerable volume of literature describing the earthworm communities of such habitats, and much of this was summarized by Lee (1985) and updated by Edwards and Bohlen (1996). There is also a considerable amount of information describing the influence of various environmental and management factors on earthworm populations, but in comparison with insects, for which the population ecology of 92many species has been subjected to quantitative analysis, earthworm population ecology is still largely at a descriptive stage. Population modeling has been used for particular purposes such as risk assessment (Baveco and De Roos 1996), but development of realistic models of field populations has been hindered by a lack of information on key life history parameters and the factors that influence them.","Book : Earthworm ecology","en",2004,"Mar","England","England","10.1201/9781482285246-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781482285246-9","10.1002/ecy.2936","Worldwide","Various","Earthworm Biology;Ecology;Behavior;and Physiology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"The action of an animal ecosystem engineer: Identification of the main mechanisms of earthworm impacts on soil microarthropods. ","Nico Eisenhauer","Nico Eisenhauer","pNon-trophic interactions are shaping soil food web structure and functions. Particularly, the action of ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, are likely to fundamentally impact the abiotic and biotic properties of their environment. The present study aimed to identify the main mechanisms through which earthworms belonging to varying ecological groups – epigeic, endogeic and anecic species – affect soil microarthropods by reviewing the literature on this topic and by performing meta-analyses./ppEarthworm ecological groups differed considerably in their impacts on microarthropods, whereas effects did not vary significantly between microarthropod taxa at the habitat scale. Inconsistent impacts of epigeic species on soil microarthropods are most likely due to differences in earthworm densities. Effects can thus be positive in the case of moderate densities or negative in the case of high densities and associated distinct changes in the physical structure of the upper soil organic layers. By contrast, impacts of endogeic earthworms appeared to be mainly negative and were primarily due to competition with microarthropods for food resources. Consequently, negative impacts on soil microarthropods intensified with increasing earthworm density and biomass. This interaction between endogeic earthworms and microarthropods is better referred to as amensalism due to the competitive predominance of earthworms. Impacts of anecic earthworm species differed significantly from that of endogeic ones; they were neutral at the habitat scale and positive on the microhabitat scale. Moreover, impacts were independent of earthworm densities due to the quasi-territorial behaviour of anecic earthworms. Positive effects were mainly attributed to the formation of stable microhabitats by anecic species; namely burrows/middens, rich in nutrients and microorganisms./ppThe present study points to the relevance of the non-trophic biotic interactions that drive the composition of belowground food webs by identifying the most essential mechanisms underlying the impacts of animal ecosystem engineers on soil microarthropods. Moreover, as earthworms emerge as important biological invaders, the results of the present study may help to fully appreciate, estimate and model the consequences of this momentous global change phenomenon.

"Invasion of a deciduous forest by earthworms: Changes in soil chemistry, microflora, microarthropods and vegetation.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Ecosystems of northern North America existed without earthworm fauna until European settlers arrived and introduced European species. The current extent of invasion by some of these species, emLumbricus terrestris L., emOctolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and emDendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with emL. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where emO. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of emL. terrestris and emO. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when emL. terrestris and emO. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of emO. tyrtaeum (−75% and −22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not.

"Ecosystem responses to exotic earthworm invasion in northern North American forests.","Nico Eisenhauer","Malte Jochum","Earth is experiencing a substantial loss of biodiversity at the global scale, while both species gains and losses are occurring at local and regional scales. The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground–belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning research.","European project Ecoworm","en",2016,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.3030/677232","http://dx.doi.org/10.3030/677232","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Northen American forest","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm effects on the incorporation of litter C and N into soil organic matter in a sugar maple forest.","Timothy J. Fahey","Patrick J. Bohlen","To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double‐labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22% ± 5.4% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm‐invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.","Ecology, ecological applications","en",2013,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1890/12-1760.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1760.1","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York state","aggregate;C:N ratio;decomposition;litter;Lumbricus;stoichiometry  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Carbon food resources of earthworms of different ecological groups as indicated by 13C compound-specific stable isotope analysis.","Olga Ferlian","Stefan Scheu","Abstract : One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed δ13C signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA δ13C profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with δ13C signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay–humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2014,"June","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.soilbio.2014602","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.06.002","10.1002/ecy.2936","Germany","Hainich, Thuringia","Clay Endogeic Fatty acids Soil organic matter Soil particle size fractions Stable carbon pools","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have far‐reaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity.Here, we present the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms and soil invertebrates based on 430 observations from 30 independent studies.Our meta‐analysis shows a significant decline of the diversity and density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm invasion with anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms were context‐dependent, such as depending on functional group richness of invasive earthworms and soil depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral soil layers, with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the mixing of soil layers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize microbial communities across soil layers.Our meta‐analysis provides a compelling evidence for negative effects of a common invasive below‐ground ecosystem engineer on below‐ground biodiversity of recipient ecosystems, which could potentially alter the ecosystem functions and services linked to soil biota.","Journal of animal ecology","en",2017,"Aug","Germany","Germany","10.1111/1365-2656.12746","https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12746 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","biodiversity change;biological invasion;ecosystem engineer;soil invertebrates;soil micro-organisms  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Linking direct and indirect pathways mediating earthworms, deer, and understory composition in Great Lakes forests.","Nicholas A. Fisichelli","Nico Eisenhauer","Ahistorical drivers such as nonnative invasive earthworms and high deer densities can have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes and plant community composition in temperate and boreal forests of North America. To assess the roles of earthworm disturbance, deer, and environmental factors in the understory, we sampled 125 mixed temperate-boreal forest sites across the western Great Lakes region. We utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to address the hypothesis that earthworm disturbance to the upper soil horizons and selective herbivory by deer are associated with depauperate understory plant communities dominated by graminoid and nonnative species. Evidence of earthworm activity was found at of our sites and had high to very high severity earthworm disturbance. The SEM fit the data well and indicated that widespread nonnative earthworm disturbance and high deer densities had similar magnitudes of impact on understory plant communities and that these impacts were partially mediated by environmental characteristics. One-third of the variation in earthworm disturbance was explained by soil pH, precipitation, and litter quality. Deer density and earthworm disturbance both increased graminoid cover while environmental variables showed direct and indirect relationships. For example, the positive relationship between temperature and graminoids was indirect through a positive temperature effect on deer density. This research characterizes an integrated set of key environmental variables driving earthworm disturbance and deer impacts on the forest understory, facilitating predictions of the locations and severity of future change in northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.","Biological Invasions","en",2012,"Dec","Germany","Germany","10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan","Carex pensylvanica;Climate;Deer browsing;Earthworm invasion;Forest soils;Graminoid cover;Invasive plants;Understory plant community","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm invasion into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests.","Lee E. Frelich","Patrick J. Bohlen","Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can influence primary producers by changing seedbed conditions, soil characteristics, flow of water, nutrients and carbon, and plant–herbivore interactions. The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.","Biological Invasions Belowground: Earthworms as Invasive Species","en",2006,"Jan","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","Temparate and boreal forests ","Aporrectodea;Dendrobaena;Exotic earthworm invasion;Lumbricus rubellus;Lumbricus terrestris;Keystone species;Minnesota forests;New York forests","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms increase plant production: a meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","Scientific Reports","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","USA","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1002/ecy.2936","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Agroecology;Ecosystem services ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Exotic earthworm invasion and microbial biomass in temperate forest soils.","Peter M. Groffman","Timothy J.

We measured the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3–5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the mineral soil. Enrichment of the mineral soil was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots. There was an increase in respiration in the mineral soil at both sites, which is consistent with a movement of organic matter and microbial biomass into the mineral soil. However, N-cycle processes (mineralization and nitrification) did not increase along with respiration. It is likely that the earthworm-induced input of C into the mineral soil created a microbial “sink” for N, preventing an increase in net mineralization and nitrification and conserving N in the soil profile.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0129-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0129-9","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New York","nitrogen cycling;nitrogen mineralization;nitrification;respiration","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms increase soil microbial biomass carrying capacity and nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Peter M. Groffman","John C. Maerz","Earthworms have been shown to produce contrasting effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics. We measured soil C and N pools and processes and traced the flow of 13C and 15N from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter into soil microbial biomass and respirable C and mineralizable and inorganic N pools in mature northern hardwood forest plots with variable earthworm communities. Previous studies have shown that plots dominated by either Lumbricus rubellus or Lumbricus terrestris have markedly lower total soil C than uncolonized plots. Here we show that total soil N pools in earthworm colonized plots were reduced much less than C, but significantly so in plots dominated by contain L. rubellus. Pools of microbial biomass C and N were higher in earthworm-colonized (especially those dominated by L. rubellus) plots and more 13C and 15N were recovered in microbial biomass and less was recovered in mineralizable and inorganic N pools in these plots. These plots also had lower rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification than uncolonized reference plots. These results suggest that earthworm stimulation of microbial biomass and activity underlie depletion of soil C and retention and maintenance of soil N pools, at least in northern hardwood forests. Earthworms increase the carrying capacity of soil for microbial biomass and facilitate the flow of N from litter into stable soil organic matter.

Here we show multiple data streams from long-term ecological research at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA suggesting that N oligotrophication in forest soils is driven by increased carbon flow from the atmosphere through soils that stimulates microbial immobilization of N and decreases available N for plants. Decreased available N in soils can result in increased N resorption by trees, which reduces litterfall N input to soils, further limiting available N supply and leading to further declines in soil N availability. Moreover, N oligotrophication has been likely exacerbated by changes in climate that increase the length of the growing season and decrease production of available N by mineralization during both winter and spring. These results suggest a need to re-evaluate the nature and extent of N cycling in temperate forests and assess how changing conditions will influence forest ecosystem response to multiple, dynamic stresses of global environmental change.","Biogeochemistry","en",2018,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s10533-018-0445-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0445-y","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","New Hampshire","Climate change;Carbon;Dissolved organic carbon;Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest;Nitrogen","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of European earthworm invasion on soil characteristics in northern hardwood forests of Minnesota.","Cindy M. Hale","John Pastor","European earthworms are colonizing worm-free hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it’s percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists.

Van Straalen","Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life’s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen‐fixing bacteria are responsible forc.5–20% (grassland and savannah) to 80% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free‐living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest thatc.20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth.

"Exotic earthworm invasions in North America: ecological and policy implications.","PAUL F. HENDRIX","PATRICK J. BOHLEN","Earthworms are the best known and, in many situations, the most important animals that live in soil. Over 3500 earthworm species have been described worldwide, and it is estimated that further surveys will reveal this number to be much larger (Reynolds 1994, Fragoso et al. 1999). Distinct taxonomic groups of earthworms have arisen on every continent except Antarctica, and, through human transport, some groups have been distributed worldwide (Jamieson 1988, Reynolds 1994). The earthworm fauna of North America, including Canada, the continental United States, Mexico, and the islands of the Caribbean, consists of both native (Nearctic and Neotropical) and exotic species imported from many other regions of the world (Fender 1995, Fragoso et al. 1995, James 1995, Reynolds 1995). Any given locality may be inhabited by all native species, all exotic species, a combination of native and exotic species, or by no earthworms at all. Relative abundance and species composition of local fauna depend greatly on soil, climate, vegetation, topography, land use history, and especially on past invasions by exotic species.  Much of our knowledge of the earthworm fauna of North America is based on the work of Gordon E. Gates who, over a 60-year career, collected, described, and cataloged many of the currently recognized taxa, both native and exotic. Beginning in 1949, Gates collaborated with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Bureau of Plant Quarantine (now Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS) to intercept oligochaetes found in “plant-associated materials” (mostly soil) being imported into the United States. Over a 32-year period (1950–1982), Gates (1976, 1982) acquired thousands of specimens and was able to determine that earthworms from all over the world were continually being imported. There is no reason to expect that this situation has changed since 1982. Indeed, as with exotic plants, fungi, and insects (Ruesink et al. 1995, Campbell 2001, Mack and Lonsdale 2001), growing global commerce may be increasing the likelihood that exotic earthworms will be introduced, both inadvertently with the importation of soil-containing materials (e.g., agricultural and horticultural products; Gates 1976, 1982, Boag and Yeates 2001, Ehrenfeld and Scott 2001) and intentionally for use in commercial applications (e.g., waste management and land bioremediation; Lee 1995, Edwards 1998). Because previous invasions by exotic earthworms have had significant impacts on soil processes and plant communities in native ecosystems (e.g., Alban and Berry 1994, Groffman and Bohlen 1999, Hale et al. 2000), there may be reason for concern over continued unrestricted importation of earthworms.  Regulatory activities have not been effective in reducing earthworm introductions in most areas of the world (Boag and Yeates 2001), probably because legal restrictions traditionally have not targeted earthworms or their propagules. There presently are no specific regulations concerning earthworm imports into the United States. Earthworm importations are regulated by APHIS under the Federal Plant Pest Act because of the potential for introduction of exotic plant pathogens in their guts and in soil that might accompany them (Tracy A. Horner, USDA APHIS, personal communication, 3 January 2002). The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe has heightened concern about earthworm imports, because some species may be vectors for that viral pathogen and others (Edwards and Bohlen 1996, Jamieson 2000). APHIS is now considering guidelines specifically for the importation of earthworms into the United States. In this article, which is derived from a report prepared recently for APHIS, we review the status of earthworms in North America, address problems associated with exotic earthworm invasions, and discuss criteria for assessing potential risks of earthworm importation.","BioSciences","en",2002,"Sep","Georgia","USA","10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:eeiina]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052%5B0801:EEIINA%5D2.0.CO;2","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","Various","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm-induced shifts in microbial diversity in soils with rare versus established invasive earthworm populations.","Alexandre B de Menezes","Peter H Thrall","p class=""chapter-para""European earthworms have colonised many parts of Australia, although their impact on soil microbial communities remains largely uncharacterised. An experiment was conducted to contrast the responses to emAporrectodea trapezoides introduction between soils from sites with established (Talmo, 64 emA. trapezoides m−2) and rare (Glenrock, 0.6 emA. trapezoides m−2) emA. trapezoides populations. Our hypothesis was that earthworm introduction would lead to similar changes in bacterial communities in both soils. The effects of earthworm introduction (earthworm activity and cadaver decomposition) did not lead to a convergence of bacterial community composition between the two soils. However, in both soils, the Firmicutes decreased in abundance and a common set of bacteria responded positively to earthworms. The increase in the abundance of emFlavobacterium, Chitinophagaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Sphingobacteriales were consistent with previous studies. Evidence for possible soil resistance to earthworms was observed, with lower earthworm survival in Glenrock microcosms coinciding with emA. trapezoides rarity in this site, lower soil organic matter and clay content and differences in the diversity and abundance of potential earthworm mutualist bacteria. These results suggest that while the impacts of earthworms vary between different soils, the consistent response of some bacteria may aid in predicting the impacts of earthworms on soil ecosystems./p","FEMS Microbiology Ecology","en",2018,"Mar","Australia","Australia","10.1093/femsec/fiy051","https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiy051 ","10.1002/ecy.2936","Australia","Talmo","16S rRNA sequencing;pasture soils;soil nitrogen;invasive earthworms;soil microbiome;soil ecology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"The influence of invasive earthworms on indigenous fauna in ecosystems previously uninhabited by earthworms.","Sonja Migge-Kleian","Liam Heneghan","Recent studies on earthworm invasion of North American soils report dramatic changes in soil structure, nutrient dynamics and plant communities in ecosystems historically free of earthworms. However, the direct and indirect impacts of earthworm invasions on animals have been largely ignored. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of earthworm invasion on other soil fauna, vertebrates as well as invertebrates.  Earthworm invasions can have positive effects on the abundance of other soil invertebrates, but such effects are often small, transient, and restricted to habitats with harsh climates or a long history of earthworm co-occurrence with other soil invertebrates. Middens and burrows can increase soil heterogeneity and create microhabitats with a larger pore size, high microbial biomass, and microclimates that are attractive to micro- and mesofauna. Under harsh climatic conditions, the aggregates formed by earthworms may increase the stability of soil microclimates. Positive effects can also be seen when comminution and mucus secretion increase the palatability of unpalatable organic material for microorganisms which are the main food of most micro- and mesofaunal groups. For larger invertebrates or small vertebrates, invasive earthworms may become important prey, with the potential to increase resource availability.  In the longer-term, the activity of invading earthworms can have a strong negative impact on indigenous faunal groups across multiple trophic levels. Evidence from field and laboratory studies indicates that the restructuring of soil layers, particularly the loss of organic horizons, physical disturbance to the soil, alteration of understory vegetation, and direct competition for food resources, lead directly and indirectly to significant declines in the abundance of soil micro- and mesofauna. Though studies of invasive earthworm impacts on the abundance of larger invertebrates or vertebrates are generally lacking, recent evidence suggests that reduced abundance of small soil fauna and alteration of soil microclimates may be contributing to declines in vertebrate fauna such as terrestrial salamanders. Preliminary evidence also suggests the potential for earthworm invasions to interact with other factors such as soil pollution, to negatively affect vertebrate populations.","Biological Invasions Belowground: Earthworms as Invasive Species (book)","en",2006,"Jan","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","N/A","Biological invasion;Collembola;Disturbance;Earthworm invasion;Oribatida;Review;Soil fauna;Salamander","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Belowground interactions with aboveground consequences: Invasive earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","Shishir Paudel","Scott R. Loss","A mounting body of research suggests that invasive nonnative earthworms substantially alter microbial communities, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These changes to AMF can cascade to affect plant communities and vertebrate populations. Despite these research advances, relatively little is known about (1) the mechanisms behind earthworms’ effects on AMF and (2) the factors that determine the outcomes of earthworm–AMF interactions (i.e., whether AMF abundance is increased or decreased and subsequent effects on plants). We predict that AMF-mediated effects of nonnative earthworms on ecosystems are nearly universal because (1) AMF are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems, (2) nonnative earthworms have become established in nearly every type of terrestrial ecosystem, and (3) nonnative earthworms, due to their burrowing and feeding behavior, greatly affect AMF with potentially profound concomitant effects on plant communities. We highlight the multiple direct and indirect effects of nonnative earthworms on plants and review what is currently known about the interaction between earthworms and AMF. We also illustrate how the effects of nonnative earthworms on plant–AMF mutualisms can alter the structure and stability of aboveground plant communities, as well as the vertebrate communities relying on these habitats. Integrative studies that assess the interactive effects of earthworms and AMF can provide new insights into the role that belowground ecosystem engineers play in altering aboveground ecological processes. Understanding these processes may improve our ability to predict the structure of plant and animal communities in earthworm-invaded regions and to develop management strategies that limit the numerous undesired impacts of earthworms.","Ecology","en",2015,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1890/15-1085.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1085","10.1002/ecy.2936","North America","N/A","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;disturbance;earthworm invasion;ecosystem engineers;plant community;plant–soil interactions  ","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworm activity and soil structure changes due to organic enrichments in vineyard system.","G. Pérès","V. Hallaire"," The effect of organic enrichment on earthworm activity and soil structure was studied in two French vineyards, by comparing control and test plots. In each vineyard the organic matter quantitatively increased the abundance and biomass of the earthworm community. These increases were associated with a higher level of species diversity and a higher evenness corresponding to the development of endogeic community. These earthworm community changes were associated with an increase in granular bioturbated areas and in macroporosity in the top soil layer. The micromorphological approach incorporated an original process of image analysis which appeared to be an appropriate method for characterizing pore morphology in this study. The pores when characterized by their size and shape could be related to ecological groups and growth stages of earthworms.","Biology and fertility of soils","en",1998,"Sep","France","France","10.1007/s003740050452","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003740050452","10.1002/ecy.2936","France ","Champagne, Mâcon, Montbré ","Organic matter  Earthworm activity  Soil structure  Micromorphology  Image analysis","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Performance of the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and between-study heterogeneity.","Jaime L. Peters","Lesley Rushton","The trim and fill method allows estimation of an adjusted meta‐analysis estimate in the presence of publication bias. To date, the performance of the trim and fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in a number of simulated meta‐analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta‐analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta‐analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between‐study heterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is nopublication bias. However, when publication bias is present the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta‐analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the presence of publication bias, when between‐study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various meta‐analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.

"Earthworm species composition affects the soil bacterial community and net nitrogen mineralization.","Maria B. Postma-Blaauw","Lijbert Brussaard","Knowledge of the effects of species diversity within taxonomic groups on nutrient cycling is important for understanding the role of soil biota in sustainable agriculture. We hypothesized that earthworm species specifically affect nitrogen mineralization, characteristically for their ecological group classifications, and that earthworm species interactions would affect mineralization through competition and facilitation effects. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three earthworm species, representative of different ecological groups (epigeic: emLumbricus rubellus; endogeic: emAporrectodea caliginosa tuberculata; and anecic: emLumbricus terrestris), and their interactions on the bacterial community, and on nitrogen mineralization from 15N-labelled crop residue and from soil organic matter./ppOur results indicate that emL. rubellus and emL. terrestris enhanced mineralization of the applied crop residue whereas emA. caliginosa had no effect. On the other hand, emL. rubellus and emA. caliginosa enhanced mineralization of the soil organic matter, whereas emL. terrestris had no effect. The interactions between different earthworm species affected the bacterial community and the net mineralization of soil organic matter. The two-species interactions between emL. rubellus and emA. caliginosa, and emL. rubellus and emL. terrestris, resulted in reduced mineral N concentrations derived from soil organic matter, probably through increased immobilization in the bacterial biomass. In contrast, the interaction between emA. caliginosa and emL. terrestris resulted in increased bacterial growth rate and reduced total soil C. When all three species were combined, the interaction between emA. caliginosa and emL. terrestris was dominant. We conclude that the effects of earthworms on nitrogen mineralization depend on the ecological traits of the earthworm species present, and can be modified by species interactions. Knowledge of these effects can be made useful in the prevention of nutrient losses and increased soil fertility in agricultural systems, that typically have a low earthworm diversity./p","Pedobiologia","en",2006,"Feb","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1016/j.pedobi.2006201","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2006.02.001","10.1002/ecy.2936","The Netherlands","De Bovenbuurt","Soil Earthworms Biodiversity Species interactions Nutrients Functional group","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Earthworms and management affect organic matter incorporation and microaggregate formation in agricultural soils.","M.M Pulleman","A.G. Jongmans","Through their feeding activities and cast production, earthworms influence both aggregate turnover and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics. We studied the impact of earthworm activity on soil macro- and microaggregation and SOM incorporation in different farming systems. Dry-sieved aggregates (4–12.5 mm) of a permanent pasture (PP), a conventional arable field (CA) and an organic arable field (OA) (0–10 and 10–20 cm depth) were separated into different aggregate fractions, which were analyzed for organic C and N. The separation was based on macromorphological characteristics that reflect the dominant process of aggregate formation and the degree of degradation. We distinguished: two classes of biogenic macroaggregates (fresh casts and welded casts); one class of physicogenic macroaggregates (angular to subangular blocky macroaggregates); and an intermediate fraction (rounded to subrounded macroaggregates). The structural arrangement of mineral particles and organic matter and the quantitative contribution of particulate organic matter (POM) and microaggregates were studied in thin sections. Total organic C contents tended to be higher in biogenic than in physicogenic macroaggregates of the PP and OA soils, whereas the reverse was found for the CA soil. Comparison of the different macroaggregate types in thin sections revealed that the worm-made macroaggregates of the PP soil were considerably enriched in fine POM and microaggregates, in which large amounts of organic matter were intimately mixed with fine mineral material. By contrast, worm casts of the CA and OA soils were hardly enriched in POM and microaggregates. Our study demonstrated that earthworms can directly initiate the formation of microaggregates, which in turn affects the physical protection of SOM against microbial decay. Farming practices that stimulate earthworm activity may thus constitute an important aspect of sustainable agricultural management. However, the much smaller amounts of POM and microaggregates present in worm casts of CA and OA than PP indicate a different impact of earthworms on C stabilization depending on land use. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact management conditions that favour the beneficial effects of earthworms on soil microstructure and associated SOM dynamics. In this respect, the use of micromorphological techniques in addition to chemical and physical analyses was shown to be very valuable.","Applied Soil Ecology","en",2004,"Oct","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.1003","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2004.10.003","10.1002/ecy.2936","The Netherlands","Zeeland","Farming systems Soil aggregation Soil organic matter Earthworm activity Micromorphology","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of non-native Asian earthworm invasion on temperate forest and prairie soils in the Midwestern US.","Jiangxiao Qiu","Monica G. Turner","Effects of invasive European earthworms in North America have been well documented, but less is known about ecological consequences of exotic Asian earthworm invasion, in particular Asian jumping worms (Amynthas) that are increasingly reported. Most earthworm invasion research has focused on forests; some Amynthas spp. are native to Asian grasslands and may thrive in prairies with unknown effects. We conducted an earthworm-addition mesocosm experiment with before–after control-impact (BACI) design and a complementary field study in southern Wisconsin, USA, in 2014 to investigate effects of a newly discovered invasion of two Asian jumping worms (Amynthas agrestis and Amynthas tokioensis) on forest and prairie litter and soil nutrient pools. In both studies, A. agrestis and A. tokioensis substantially reduced surface litter (84–95 % decline in foliage litter mass) and increased total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the upper 0–5 cm of soils over the 4-month period from July through October. Soil inorganic nitrogen (ammonium– and nitrate–N) concentration increased across soil depths of 0–25 cm, with greater effects on nitrate–N. Dissolved organic carbon concentration also increased, e.g., 71–108 % increase in the mesocosm experiment. Effects were observed in both forest and prairie soils, with stronger effects in forests. Effects were most pronounced late in the growing season when earthworm biomass likely peaked. Depletion of the litter layer and rapid mineralization of nutrients by non-native Asian jumping worms may make ecosystems more susceptible to nutrient losses, and effects may cascade to understory herbs and other soil biota.","Biological Invasions","en",2016,"Feb","USA","USA","10.1007/s10530-016-1264-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1264-5","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","southern Wisconsin","Amynthas agrestis;Amynthas tokioensis;Asian jumping worm;Ecosystem change;Nutrient cycling;Wisconsin","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Elemental and mineralogical changes in soils due to bioturbation along an earthworm invasion chronosequence in Northern Minnesota.","Kathryn Resner","Stephen Sebestyen","Minnesota forested soils have evolved without the presence of earthworms since the last glacial retreat. When exotic earthworms arrive, enhanced soil bioturbation often results in dramatic morphological and chemical changes in soils with negative implications for the forests’ sustainability. However, the impacts of earthworm invasion on geochemical processes in soils are not well understood. This study attempts to quantify the role of earthworm invasion in mineral chemical weathering and nutrient dynamics along an earthworm invasion chronosequence in a sugar maple forest in Northern Minnesota. Depth and rates of soil mixing can be tracked with atmospherically derived short lived radioisotopes 210Pb and 137Cs. Their radioactivities increase in the lower A horizon at the expense of the peak activities near the soil surface, which indicate that soil mixing rate and its depth reach have been enhanced by earthworms. Enhanced soil mixing by earthworms is consistent with the ways that the vertical profiles of elemental and mineralogical compositions were affected by earthworm invasion. Biologically cycled Ca and P have peak concentrations near the soil surface prior to earthworm invasion. However, these peak abundances significantly declined in the earthworm invaded soils presumably due to enhanced soil mixing. It is clear that enhanced soil mixing due to earthworms also profoundly altered the vertical distribution of most mineral species within A horizons. Though the mechanisms are not clear yet, earthworm invasion appears to have contributed to net losses of clay mineral species and opal from the A horizons. As much as earthworms vertically relocated minerals and elements, they also intensify the contacts between organic matter and cations as shown in the increased amount of Ca and Fe in organically complexed and in exchangeable pools. With future studies on soil mixing rates and elemental leaching, this study will quantitatively and mechanically address the role of earthworms in geochemical evolution of soils and forests’ nutrient dynamics.","Applied Geochemistry","en",2011,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011347","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2011.03.047","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Minnesota","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

Thus, mesocosms were constructed to examine changes in microbial biomass and microfaunal communities inside artificial compared with earthworm burrows. Four treatments were established: (i) no worms (CTRL); (ii) unlined, artificial burrows (ARTF); (iii) corn (Zea mays L.) leaf litter‐lined, artificial burrows (LEAF); and (iv) Lumbricus terrestris (L.) burrows (WORM). There were no consistent differences in community structures between unlined, artificial burrows and control soils during a 16‐wk incubation. In contrast, protozoan numbers were elevated throughout the experiment in LEAF and WORM. A succession of nematode abundances occurred in LEAF, with plant parasitic and Tylenchid nematode numbers peaking at 5 wk, followed by high bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode numbers. In WORM, bacterivorous nematode numbers and active bacterial biomass were elevated for 1 and 3 wk, respectively, before declining. Active fungal biomass increased in WORM, whereas fungivorous nematodes were inhibited in earthworm burrows. While litter incorporation appeared to accelerate the rate of trophic interactions in artificial burrows, the effects of earthworms appeared to transcend that of litter translocation into soil, with earthworms differentially selecting for particular food web dynamics.","Soil Science Society America Journal","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.2136/sssaj2004.1160","http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.1160","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Rhode Island, Kingston","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Influence of fragmentation and bioturbation on the decomposition of 14C-labelled beech leaf litter.","Stefan Scheu","Volkmar Wolters","Abstract : One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed δ13C signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA δ13C profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with δ13C signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay–humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",1991,"June ","Germany","Germany","10.1016/0038-0717(91)90039-m","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(91)90039-m","10.1002/ecy.2936","France","Villers, Savigny","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Effects of exotic earthworms on soil phosphorus cycling in two broadleaf temperate forests.","Esteban R. Suarez","Melany C. Fisk","We compared the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) in northern hardwood forest plots invaded by exotic earthworms versus adjacent uninvaded reference plots. In three of the six pairs of plots, earthworm invasion resulted in significantly more total P in the upper 12 cm of soil. The finding of increased amounts of unavailable and occluded inorganic P forms in the invaded plots suggests that earthworm activity mobilized unweathered soil particles from deeper layers of the soil, increasing the stocks of total P in surface soils. In two pairs of plots, the earthworm-invaded soils had less total P than the reference soils. In these plots, earthworm activity resulted in augmented rates of P cycling and alteration of the physical structure of the soil that increased loss of P in leaching water, reducing the total amount of P. We hypothesize that the different effects of earthworm invasion on the soil P cycle result from unique characteristics of the ecological groups of earthworms dominating each site. The invaded plots with increased total P were dominated by the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris, a large earthworm that constructs deep, vertical burrows and is effective at moving soil materials from and to deeper layers of the profile. In contrast, the earthworm-invaded plots where the total P in the surface soil decreased were dominated by the epi-endogeic species L. rubellus, which feeds and lives in the upper organic layers of the soil. In these plots, earthworms significantly increased the amount of readily exchangeable P in the soil, increasing the loss of this element in leaching water.","Ecosystems ","en",2004,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-003-0128-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-003-0128-x","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","Arnot forest, New York","exotic earthworms;invasions;phosphorus cycle;northern hardwood forests","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Invasive earthworm species and nitrogen cycling in remnant forest patches.","Katalin Szlavecz","Ian Yesilonis","Invasive non-native earthworms in forested areas of the northeastern United States are of concern since they have the potential to greatly change the nutrient dynamics of these ecosystems. Urban landscapes are particularly susceptible to non-native species invasions. In this study, we assessed earthworm communities and nitrogen transformations rates in urban and rural forest patches of the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan area, USA. We expected to observe a mixture of native and non-native species at the sites because the region has never been glaciated. The fauna was dominated by European lumbricids. Density and biomass varied between 5 and 288 ind m−2 and 5.2 and 144.0 g m−2, respectively, with urban forests having higher abundances than rural forests. In laboratory incubations, urban forest soils had higher potential N-transformation rates. Both N-mineralization and nitrification rates were positively correlated with soil pH. However, controls on earthworm communities and N-cycling are complex in the Baltimore region, because parent material and soil type also change along the urban–rural gradient. Further studies will separate out land use and inherent soil controls on earthworm populations and N-transformation rates.

"Ecosystem effects of non-native earthworms in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests.","Katalin Szlavecz","Csaba Csuzdi","In many mid-Atlantic forests where both native and non-native earthworms exist, it is the non-native species that are the dominant component of the soil macrofauna. Few earthworm ecology studies, however, focus attention on these forest systems in order to determine the relative ecological roles and potential interactions of the native and non-native earthworms. In a series of field samplings and experimental manipulations we collected data on the effects of earthworms on below-and aboveground ecosystem processes. Earthworm abundance and the ecological processes measured were dynamic in space and time across the range of study sites. Leaf litter decay rates doubled at sites that had abundant non-native earthworms. Earthworms also altered the abundance of soil fungi, the activity of extracellular enzymes, soil respiration, and the growth of tree seedlings but the effects varied among sites depending on differences in land-use history and forest age. Red oak seedling growth was less at sites that had abundant earthworms but tulip poplar and red maple seedlings grew equally well with and without abundant earthworms. These preliminary results suggest that non-native earthworms have significant ecosystem effects, even in forests where native earthworms still occur. Land use history, however, plays an important role in determining what those effects will be, and these effects are likely to be dynamic, depending on the abundance of non-native earthworms.","Biological Invasions","en",2011,"Feb","USA","Hungary","10.1007/s10530-011-9959-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-9959-0","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","forests at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), Maryland","Invasive earthworms;Leaf litter decay;Soil respiration;Microbial activity;Seedling growth","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Bias and efficiency of meta-analytic variance estimators in the random-effects model.","Wolfgang Viechtbauer","Wolfgang Viechtbauer","The meta-analytic random effects model assumes that the variability in effect size estimates drawn from a set of studies can be decomposed into two parts: heterogeneity due to random population effects and sampling variance. In this context, the usual goal is to estimate the central tendency and the amount of heterogeneity in the population effect sizes. The amount of heterogeneity in a set of effect sizes has implications regarding the interpretation of the meta-analytic findings and often serves as an indicator for the presence of potential moderator variables. Five population heterogeneity estimators were compared in this article analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations with respect to their bias and efficiency.

"Terrestrial ecosystem responses to species gains and losses.","David A. Wardle","Wim H. Van der Putten","Ecosystems worldwide are losing some species and gaining others, resulting in an interchange of species that is having profound impacts on how these ecosystems function. However, research on the effects of species gains and losses has developed largely independently of one another. Recent conceptual advances regarding effects of species gain have arisen from studies that have unraveled the mechanistic basis of how invading species with novel traits alter biotic interactions and ecosystem processes. In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes. Species gains and losses are both consequences and drivers of global change; thus, explicit integration of research on how both processes simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning is key to determining the response of the Earth system to current and future human activities.","Science","en",2011,"Oct","Sweden","The Netherlands","10.1126/science.1197479","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197479","10.1002/ecy.2936","Worldwide (Brazil, Chile, New Zaeland, Australia, North America,Scotland)","Southern Chile, Wisonsin.","N/A","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.

"Chemoautotrophic nitrification in acidic forest soils along an urban-to-rural transect.","W Zhu","Carreiro, MM","We studied N-mineralization and nitrification in oak forest soils along a 130 km urban-re-rural transect in the New York City metropolitan area. We found most urban and suburban stands had a substantial amount of extractable soil nitrate from July to December 1996, but nitrate pools in the rural stands were negligible. Lab incubations showed that urban and suburban soils nitrified rapidly, but the rural soils did not. Although soil pH was acidic in all stands, nitrification was totally inhibited by acetylene, indicating control of this process by chemoautotrophic rather than by heterotrophic microbes. When we amended soils with NH4+ or P, or raised their pH, nitrification in rural soils was not stimulated, nor was it further elevated in urban soils. Raising pH did, however, increase NH4+ production in all soils. We hypothesize that exotic earthworms, which are present in the urban and suburban stands but not in. the rural stands, may create soil conditions that favor autotrophic nitrifiers.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",1999,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00025-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(99)00025-5","10.1002/ecy.2936","USA","oak forest soils along a 130 km urban-re-rural transect in the New York City metropolitan area","Keywords + : HETEROTROPHIC NITRIFICATION;NITROGEN MINERALIZATION;SECONDARY SUCCESSION;PINE FOREST;NITRATE;ECOSYSTEMS;DENITRIFICATION;AVAILABILITY;ENRICHMENT;GRASSLAND","ammonium; earthworm ecological group; element flux; exotic earthworms; nitrate; nitrification; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; pH; phosphorus; soil carbon; water content.
