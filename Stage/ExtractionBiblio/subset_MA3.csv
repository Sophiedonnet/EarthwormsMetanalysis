"The unseen invaders: introduced earthworms as drivers of change in plant communities in North American forests (a meta-analysis)","Dylan Craven","Nico Eisenhauer","Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning. While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests. Changing plant functional composition in these forests may have long‐lasting effects on ecosystem functioning.","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY ","en",2016,"Mar","Chile","Germany","10.1111/gcb.13446","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13446","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","introduced earthworms;plant communities;plant diversity;biological invasions;earthworm invasion;community composition;meta-analysis","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Different earthworm ecological groups interactively impact seedling establishment.","Roman Asshoff","Nico Eisenhauer","There is increasing evidence that direct interactions between earthworms and seeds impact the assembly of plant communities. However, effects of earthworms of different ecological groups and their interactions on plant germination and establishment are little known. We set up a full-factorial greenhouse experiment in order to explore impacts of different ecological groups of earthworms (epigeic, endogeic and anecic) on the establishment of seedlings. The three ecological groups of earthworms affected seedling establishment in an interactive way with the effects varying in time. While anecic earthworms detrimentally affected the number of established seedlings, impacts of epigeic and endogeic species depended on the presence of earthworms belonging to other ecological groups. Impacts of anecic earthworms were more significant and consistent than those of epigeic and endogeic ones pointing to the dominance of the effect of anecic earthworms for seedling establishment. The initial positive effect of the combined presence of epigeic and endogeic earthworms compared to treatments with only endogeic and only anecic earthworms was likely due to the acceleration of seed germination and elevated nutrient availability for seedlings in earthworm casts. By contrast, reduced numbers of seedlings in presence of both epigeic and endogeic earthworms compared to the control treatment might have been due to seedling predation after the litter layer had disappeared. The results extend current knowledge on interactions between earthworms and seeds by showing that, in addition to anecic species, also epigeic and endogeic species influence seedling establishment with their effect depending on the presence of anecic species. Moreover, the results indicate that impacts of earthworms vary with the developmental stage of seedlings highlighting the importance of interactions between earthworms and seeds.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY ","en",2010,"Sep_Oct","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.ejsobi.2010605","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2010.06.005","10.1111/gcb.13446","Germany","North Rhine-Westphalia","Anecic earthworms;Endogeic earthworms;Epigeic earthworms;Germination;Grassland Seeds;The Jena experiment","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Historical anthropogenic disturbances influence patterns of non-native earthworm and plant invasions in a temperate primary forest.","Robin Beauséjour","Mark Vellend","Time lags are of potentially great importance during biological invasions. For example, significant delays can occur between the human activities permitting the arrival of an invader, the establishment of this new species, and the manifestation of its impacts. In this context, to assess the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, it may become necessary to include a historical perspective. In this study, we reconstructed the history of human activities in a temperate forest now protected as a nature reserve to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the impact of human disturbances (e.g. trails, old quarries), as well as environmental factors, in explaining the probability of occurrence and the intensity of invasion by non-native earthworms and plants. The present-day patterns of distribution and intensity of earthworms and plants were better explained by proximity to the oldest human disturbances (initiated more than a century ago) than by proximity to more recent disturbances or to all disturbances combined. We conclude that understanding present-day patterns of non-native species invasions may often require reconstructing the history of human disturbances that occurred decades or even centuries in the past.","Biological Invasions ","en",2015,"Avr","Canada","Canada","10.1007/s10530-014-0794-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0794-y","10.1111/gcb.13446","Canada","Gault Nature Reserve","Human activities;Ecological legacies;Nature reserve;Lumbricidae;Taraxacum officinalis;Historical ecology;Time lag","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Non-native invasive earthworms as agents of change in northern temperate forests.","Patrick Joseph Bohlen","Parkinson, Dennis","Exotic earthworms from Europe and Asia are invading many northern forests in North America that currently lack native earthworms, providing an opportunity to assess the role of this important group of invertebrates in forest ecosystems. Research on earthworm invasions has focused on changes in soil structure and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling that occur following invasion. These changes include the mixing of organic and mineral soil horizons, decreases in soil C storage, and equivocal effects on N cycling. Less well studied are changes in the soil foodwebs that accompany earthworm invasion. Soils of north temperate forests harbor a tremendous diversity of microorganisms and invertebrates, whose distribution and abundance can be substantially altered by earthworm invasion. Furthermore, invasive earthworms can affect understory plant communities, raising concerns over the loss of rare native herbs in some areas. The ecological consequences of earthworm invasion are mediated through physical, geochemical, and biological effects. These effects vary with different earthworm species, as well as with the characteristics of the site being invaded. Earthworm invasions may have important interactions with other rapid changes predicted for northern forests in the coming decades, including climate and land-use change, increased nutrient deposition, and other biological invasions.","FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT ","en",2004,"Oct","USA","Canada","10.3410/f.726131311.793514356","https://doi.org/10.2307/3868431","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Northern forests, North America.","Keywords +: DENDROBAENA-OCTAEDRA;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;MICROARTHROPOD ABUNDANCES;MICROFUNGAL COMMUNITY;SOIL;CARBON;DECOMPOSITION;NITROGEN;IMPACTS;RESPIRATION","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"What limits trees in c4 grasslands and savannas?","William J. Bond","William J. Bond","Though the distribution of global vegetation can generally be predicted from climate, grasslands are an exception. C4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire, herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C4 grassy biomes.

"How do earthworms affect microfloral and faunal community diversity?","George G. Brown","George G. Brown","Much of the work regarding earthworm effects on other organisms has focused on the functional significance of microbial-earthworm interactions, and little is known on the effects of earthworms on microfloral and faunal diversity. Earthworms can affect soil microflora and fauna populations directly and indirectly by three main mechanisms: (1) comminution, burrowing and casting; (2) grazing; (3) dispersal. These activities change the soil's physico-chemical and biological status and may cause drastic shifts in the density, diversity, structure and activity of microbial and faunal communities within the drilosphere. Certain organisms and species may be enhanced, reduced or not be affected at all depending on their ability to adapt to the particular conditions of different earthworm drilospheres. A large host of factors (including CaCO3, enzymes, mucus and antimicrobial substances) influence the ability of preferentially or randomly ingested organisms to survive (or not) passage through the earthworm gut, and their resultant capacity to recover and proliferate (or not) in earthworm casts. Small organisms, particularly microflora and microfauna, with limited ability to move within the soil, may benefit from the (comparatively) long ranging movements of earthworms. Microflora and smaller fauna appear to be particularly sensitive to earthworm activities, and priming effects enhancing nutrient release, particularly in casts, are common. Larger fauna such as microarthropods, enchytraeids and Isopods may be enhanced under some conditions (e.g., in earthworm middens), but in other cases earthworm activity may lead to a decrease in their populations due to competition for food (microbes and organic materials), and spatial and temporal changes in food abundance. Nevertheless, considering the presently available data, the beneficial interactions of earthworms and microflora and fauna appear to far outweigh the potential negative effects. However, much is still unknown regarding the interactions of earthworms of different ecological categories on the diversity and function of microfloral and faunal communities, and much more interdisciplinary research is needed to assess the potential role of earthworms in regulating the diversity of microflora and fauna in soil systems and the potentially beneficial or harmful effects this regulation may have on ecosystem function and plant growth in different ecosystems.","Plant and soil ","en",1995,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-011-0479-1_22","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","USA","diversity;earthworms;soil fauna;soil microflora;soil processes ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Relative abundance and seasonal activity of earthworms (Lumbricidae and Megascolecidae) as determined by hand-sorting and formalin extraction in forest soils on the southern Appalachian Piedmont.","M.A. Callaham","P.F. Hendrix","The relative efficiency of different sampling methods for earthworms may vary with site characteristics, season and earthworm species. We conducted a study in which earthworms were collected by hand-sorting and by formalin extraction in a successional, mixed hardwood-pine forest. The efficiency of each collecting technique was assessed in terms of seasonal trends, soil physical properties and species collected. Earthworm community age structure and seasonal temperature and moisture trends were the factors most integral to the efficiency of each technique. Results indicate that for the part of the year in which small juvenile earthworms were most abundant (November-May), hand-sorting was far superior to formalin extraction. However, for the remainder of the year, the efficiency of the two techniques did not vary significantly. The formalin extraction method was more effective than hand-sorting for the collection of Lumbricus terrestris L., but not for any other species. Soil physical properties such as pH and texture, while important in distributional patterns of earthworms, did not have a significant effect on the efficiency of the collection techniques.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",1997,"Mar-Apr","USA","USA","10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00095-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0038-0717(96)00095-8","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","University of Athens, Georgia","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Root foraging influences plant growth responses to earthworm foraging.","Erin K. Cameron","Erin M. Bayne","Interactions among the foraging behaviours of co-occurring animal species can impact population and community dynamics; the consequences of interactions between plant and animal foraging behaviours have received less attention. In North American forests, invasions by European earthworms have led to substantial changes in plant community composition. Changes in leaf litter have been identified as a critical indirect mechanism driving earthworm impacts on plants. However, there has been limited examination of the direct effects of earthworm burrowing on plant growth. Here we show a novel second pathway exists, whereby earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.) impact plant root foraging. In a minirhizotron experiment, roots occurred more frequently in burrows and soil cracks than in the soil matrix. The roots of Achillea millefolium L. preferentially occupied earthworm burrows, where nutrient availability was presumably higher than in cracks due to earthworm excreta. In contrast, the roots of Campanula rotundifolia L. were less likely to occur in burrows. This shift in root behaviour was associated with a 30% decline in the overall biomass of C. rotundifolia when earthworms were present. Our results indicate earthworm impacts on plant foraging can occur indirectly via physical and chemical changes to the soil and directly via root consumption or abrasion and thus may be one factor influencing plant growth and community change following earthworm invasion. More generally, this work demonstrates the potential for interactions to occur between the foraging behaviours of plants and soil animals and emphasizes the importance of integrating behavioural understanding in foraging studies involving plants.","PLOS ONE ","en",2014,"Sep","Canada","Canada","10.1371/journal.pone108873","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108873","10.1111/gcb.13446","Canada","boreal forest of northeastern Alberta (54°36′N, 110° 59′W)","Earthworms;Foraging;Animal behavior;Invasive species;Leaves;Plant-herbivore interactions;Root growth;Species interactions","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global meta-analysis of the impacts of terres trial invertebrate invaders on species, communities and ecosystems.","Erin K. Cameron","Mar Cabeza","Terrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of alien species world‐wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of their effects on native species and ecosystems has not been explored. We conducted a meta‐analysis to examine the ecological impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study methodology (observational versus experimental).LocationGlobal.MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting a random effects meta‐analysis using 112 articles reporting data from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16 insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders.ResultsOn average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant fitness (52%), animal diversity (33%) and animal abundance (29%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41% higher in the presence of invaders, while other ecosystem‐level variables such as nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction. Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance, whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large variation among studies.Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems, with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts. However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader. There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are involved.","Global Ecology and Biogeography","en",2016,"Jan","Finland","Finland","10.1111/geb.12436","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12436","10.1111/gcb.13446","Location: Global (website information)","Various","N/A","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive earthworms as seed predators of temperate forest plants.","Colin M. Cassin","Peter M. Kotanen","Soil seedbanks play a key role in forest plant communities, contributing to regeneration and acting as a refuge from seed predators. This study provides evidence that seeds entering the soil seed-bank are vulnerable to granivory by invasive earthworms in temperate forests. Overall, 73 % of seeds of 6 ecologically important forest species were removed from the soil surface over 2 weeks in a Lumbricus terrestris microcosm experiment; 30 % vanished entirely, and presumably were destroyed. The invasive garlic mustard, Alliaria petiolata, was subject to the highest rates of removal. In contrast, results from a field exclosure experiment using 23 species of seed indicate that while seed predation by worms is still detectable, predation by rodents often may mask impacts of earthworms under natural conditions. Worms and rodents preferred different sizes of seeds: while seed predation by rodents was high in mid-to large-seeded species, earthworms tended to prefer smaller seeds. These findings suggest that although rodents are the main driver of seed predation, invasive earthworms may act as an additional ecological filter, and potentially may further influence the species composition of forest plant communities.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2016,"Jun","Canada","Canada","10.1007/s10530-016-1101-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1101-x","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","Invasive earthworms;Seed predation;Granivory;Seed bank;Lumbricus terrestris;Exotic species","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Non-native earthworms promote plant invasion by ingesting seeds and modifying soil properties.","Julia Clause","Sébastien Barot","Earthworms can have strong direct effects on plant communities through consumption and digestion of seeds, however it is unclear how earthworms may influence the relative abundance and composition of plant communities invaded by non-native species. In this study, earthworms, seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling locations were selected based on historical land-use practices, including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found, dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides. Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with the associated plant community.","ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY ","en",2015,"Apr","France","France","10.1016/j.actao.2015204","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2015.02.004","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","grassland of central California","Invasive species;Californian grassland;Earthworm casts;Feedback;Interactions;Seed bank","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Exotic earthworms of great lakes forests: a search for indicator plant species in maple forests.","Kathryn Corio","Gary Fewless","The invasion of exotic earthworms in previously earthworm-free northern deciduous forests has been linked to the disappearance of forest floor litter, declines in plant species richness, and the development of monotypic stands of Carex pensylvanica. However, the impact of exotic earthworms on the regeneration of trees and understory plants is largely unknown. We examined the relationships between earthworm density, plant species richness, leaf litter accumulation, number of tree (Acer) seedlings, and cover of C. pensylvanica at 14 sites in mesic hardwood forests of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Earthworm biomass, especially of the genera Lumbricus, Aporrectodea, and Octolasion was negatively associated with leaf litter mass and number of Acer seedlings. Nine plant species, including two spring ephemerals (Dicentra cucullaria and Osmorhiza claytonii), a sedge (Carex deweyana), and an invasive mint (Galeopsis tetrahit) were negatively correlated with exotic earthworm densities. Dtyopteris intermedia and Allium tricoccum, on the other hand, were associated with high earthworm densities. The activities of exotic earthworms appear to have significant impacts on Acer regeneration and the persistence of many herbaceous plants. Our findings suggest that the effects of exotic earthworms on litter mass are strongly related to the observed effects on species composition. Sensitive species can be used as indicators of high and low earthworm densities and might be useful for identifying forests of high conservation value where future invasions of exotic earthworms should be prevented.","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT ","en",2009,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.foreco.2009513","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.013","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Vilas, Forest, and Oconto Counties, Wisconsin.","Acer saccharum;Earthworm invasion;Invasive species;Indicator species;Northern hardwood forest","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global diversity of drought tolerance and grassland climate-change resilience.","Joseph M. Craine","Joseph E. Fargione","Drought reduces plant productivity, induces widespread plant mortality and limits the geographic distribution of plant species(1-7). As climates warm and precipitation patterns shift in the future(8,9), understanding the distribution of the diversity of plant drought tolerance is central to predicting future ecosystem function and resilience to climate change(10-12). These questions are especially pressing for the world's 11,000 grass species(13), which dominate a large fraction of the terrestrial biosphere(14), yet are poorly characterized with respect to responses to drought. Here, we show that physiological drought tolerance, which varied tenfold among 426 grass species, is well distributed both climatically and phylogenetically, suggesting most native grasslands are likely to contain a high diversity of drought tolerance. Consequently, local species may help maintain ecosystem functioning in response to changing drought regimes without requiring long-distance migrations of grass species. Furthermore, physiologically drought-tolerant species had higher rates of water and carbon dioxide exchange than intolerant species, indicating that severe droughts may generate legacies for ecosystem functioning. In all, our findings suggest that diverse grasslands throughout the globe have the potential to be resilient to drought in the face of climate change through the local expansion of drought-tolerant species.","NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE ","en",2013,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1038/nclimate1634","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1634","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","N/A","Climate-change ecology;Drought;Grassland ecology ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Single and interactive effects of deer and earth worms on non-native plants.","Andrea Dávalos","Bernd Blossey","Understanding drivers of plant invasions is essential to predict and successfully manage invasions. Across forests in North America, increased white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance and non-native earthworms may facilitate non-native plant invasions. While each agent may exert independent effects, earthworms and deer often co-occur and their combined effects are difficult to predict based solely on knowledge of their individual effects. Using a network of twelve forested sites that differ in earthworm density, we evaluated deer exclusion effects (30 × 30 m; with an adjacent similar sized unfenced control plot) on cover, growth and reproduction of three non-native plant species: Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii and Microstegium vimineum. In addition, we assessed interactive effects of deer exclusion and earthworm invasions on B. thunbergii ring-growth. Five years after fence construction, A. petiolata frequency and density, B. thunbergii height, and M. vimineum cover were all significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots. In addition, B. thunbergii ring-growth was significantly lower in fenced compared to open plots, and ring-growth was positively correlated with earthworm density. Moreover, deer access and earthworm density synergistically interacted resulting in highest B. thunbergii ring-growth in open plots at sites with higher earthworm density. Results indicate facilitative effects of deer on non-native plant species and highlight the importance of understanding interactions among co-occurring factors in order to understand non-native species success. Successful long-term control of invasive plants may require a reduction in deer abundance, rather than just removing invasive plant species.","FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT ","en",2015,"Apr","USA","USA","10.1016/j.foreco.2015426","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2015.04.026","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","US Army Garrison West Point, New York","Alliaria petiolata;Berberis thunbergii;Dendroecology;Earthworm invasion;Microstegium vimineum;White-tailed deer","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Here, we discuss our current knowledge of aboveground and belowground diversity links from a global to a local scale. Global diversity peaks towards the Equator for large, aboveground organisms, but not for small (mainly belowground) organisms, suggesting that there are size-related biodiversity gradients in global aboveground-belowground linkages. The generalization of aboveground-belowground diversity relationships, and their role in ecosystem functioning, requires surveys at scales that are relevant to the organisms and ecosystem properties. Habitat sizes and diversity gradients can differ significantly between aboveground and belowground organisms and between ecosystems. These gradients in biodiversity and plant community trait perception need to be acknowledged when studying aboveground-belowground biodiversity linkages.","TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION ","en",2005,"Nov","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1515/9781400847297.105","http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400847297.105","10.1111/gcb.13446","Worldwide (terrestrial ecosystem)","Various","Keywords + : MYCORRHIZAL FUNGAL DIVERSITY;COMMUNITY COMPOSITION;SPECIES-DIVERSITY;PLANT-COMMUNITIES;INSECT HERBIVORY;SOIL COMMUNITY;BIODIVERSITY;GRASSLAND SCALE;ECOLOGY ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm invasion, white-tailed deer and seedling establishment in deciduous forests of north-eastern North America.","Annise Dobson","Bernd Blossey","Earthworm invasions and high deer populations are among many stressors threatening long‐term population viability of forest understorey plants in north‐eastern North America. Stressor effects are typically tested one at a time; however, stressors often co‐occur and plants respond to effects of multiple stressors simultaneously.We used a factorial design to test independent and combined effects of non‐native earthworms and native white‐tailed deer on survival of seedling transplants of 15 native understorey plants in five forests in New York State.Earthworm biomass was negatively correlated with survival of 12 of 15 species. We found no interactive effect of deer and earthworms, but did find a positive, non‐consumptive effect of deer on Geranium maculatum and Polygonum virginianum survival.Deer and earthworm presence/absence indirectly influenced other trophic levels: earthworm presence increased the likelihood of insect attack, and deer exclusion increased the likelihood of rodent disturbance of transplants.Synthesis. Invasive earthworms negatively affected seedling survival of many understorey plants, including species previously thought to benefit from earthworm associations. This effect was a function of earthworm biomass, a surrogate for earthworm activity. We expect deer herbivory to increase in importance, including indirect effects, as seedlings grow into browse height over the next years.

"Assemblage time series reveal biodiversity change but not systematic loss.","Maria Dornelas","Anne E. Magurran","The extent to which biodiversity change in local assemblages contributes to global biodiversity loss is poorly understood. We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity.

"Non-native anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.) reduce seed germination and seedling survival of temperate and boreal trees species.","Mélanie Drouin","Joann Whalen","Recent studies have shown that the introduction of non-native earthworms in previously earthworm-free soils may have negative impacts on the recruitment of certain understory plant species in northern temperate forests. There is a need, therefore, to understand the mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon. A microcosm study was conducted to test the effects of the anecic earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris L, on the number of days for germination, % seed germination, seedling survival and seedling biomass of 14 tree species native to southern Quebec (Canada). Seeds of these species were germinated and grown in the presence or absence of L terrestris. The presence of earthworms significantly reduced % seed germination of seven tree species, as well as seedling survival of three tree species. The germination date of three tree species was significantly affected, either positively or negatively, by the presence of earthworms. Earthworms had no effect on seedling biomass. Results suggest that the introduction of L. terrestris into forested ecosystems of southern Quebec may potentially alter overstory composition through several mechanisms that differentially affect the recruitment of various tree species in the understory.","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY","en",2014,"Mar","Canada","Canada","10.1016/j.apsoil.2013.1106","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2013.11.006","10.1111/gcb.13446","Canada","near the town of Windsor","Lumbricus terrestris;Northern temperate and boreal tree species;Seed germination;Seedling survival","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"The action of an animal ecosystem engineer: identification of the main mechanisms of earthworm impacts on soil microarthropods.","Nico Eisenhauer","Nico Eisenhauer","Non-trophic interactions are shaping soil food web structure and functions. Particularly, the action of ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, are likely to fundamentally impact the abiotic and biotic properties of their environment. The present study aimed to identify the main mechanisms through which earthworms belonging to varying ecological groups - epigeic, endogeic and anecic species - affect soil microarthropods by reviewing the literature on this topic and by performing meta-analyses.  Earthworm ecological groups differed considerably in their impacts on microarthropods, whereas effects did not vary significantly between microarthropod taxa at the habitat scale. Inconsistent impacts of epigeic species on soil microarthropods are most likely due to differences in earthworm densities. Effects can thus be positive in the case of moderate densities or negative in the case of high densities and associated distinct changes in the physical structure of the upper soil organic layers. By contrast, impacts of endogeic earthworms appeared to be mainly negative and were primarily due to competition with microarthropods for food resources. Consequently, negative impacts on soil microarthropods intensified with increasing earthworm density and biomass. This interaction between endogeic earthworms and microarthropods is better referred to as amensalism due to the competitive predominance of earthworms. Impacts of anecic earthworm species differed significantly from that of endogeic ones; they were neutral at the habitat scale and positive on the microhabitat scale. Moreover, impacts were independent of earthworm densities due to the quasi-territorial behaviour of anecic earthworms. Positive effects were mainly attributed to the formation of stable microhabitats by anecic species; namely burrows/middens, rich in nutrients and microorganisms.  The present study points to the relevance of the non-trophic biotic interactions that drive the composition of belowground food webs by identifying the most essential mechanisms underlying the impacts of animal ecosystem engineers on soil microarthropods. Moreover, as earthworms emerge as important biological invaders, the results of the present study may help to fully appreciate, estimate and model the consequences of this momentous global change phenomenon. Particularly, the spread of exotic epigeic and endogeic earthworm species likely threatens soil microarthropod density, diversity and functions.

"Invasibility of experimental grassland communities: the role of earthworms, plant functional group identity and seed size.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Invasions of natural communities by non‐indigenous species threaten native biodiversity and are currently rated as one of the most important global‐scale environmental problems. The mechanisms that make communities resistant to invasions and drive the establishment success of seedlings are essential both for management and for understanding community assembly and structure. Especially in grasslands, anecic earthworms are known to function as ecosystem engineers, however, their direct effects on plant community composition and on the invasibility of plant communities via plant seed burial, ingestion and digestion are poorly understood.In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the impact ofLumbricus terrestris, plant functional group identity and seed size of plant invader species and plant functional group of the established plant community on the number and biomass of plant invaders. We set up 120 microcosms comprising four plant community treatments, two earthworm treatments and three plant invader treatments containing three seed size classes.Earthworm performance was influenced by an interaction between plant functional group identity of the established plant community and that of invader species. The established plant community and invader seed size affected the number of invader plants significantly, while invader biomass was only affected by the established community. Since earthworm effects on the number and biomass of invader plants varied with seed size and plant functional group identity they probably play a key role in seedling establishment and plant community composition.Seeds and germinating seedlings in earthworm burrows may significantly contribute to earthworm nutrition, but this deserves further attention.Lumbricus terrestrislikely behaves like a ‘farmer’ by collecting plant seeds which cannot directly be swallowed or digested. Presumably, these seeds are left in middens and become eatable after partial microbial decay. Increased earthworm numbers in more diverse plant communities likely contribute to the positive relationship between plant species diversity and resistance against invaders.","OIKOS ","en",2008,"Jul","Germany","Germany","10.1111/j030-1299.2008.16812.x","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40235493","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A ","N/A ","Keywords +: SPECIES-RICHNESS;DIVERSITY;INVASION;GROWTH;ECOLOGY;ESTABLISHMENT;LUMBRICIDAE;DISTURBANCE;HERBIVORY;PATTERNS","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasion of a deciduous forest by earthworms: changes in soil chemistry, microflora, microarthropods and vegetation.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Ecosystems of northern North America existed without earthworm fauna until European settlers arrived and introduced European species. The current extent of invasion by some of these species, Lumbricus terrestris L., Octolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (-75% and -22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.

The aim of the present greenhouse experiment was to investigate the effects of three apparently anecic earthworm species on wheat seed burial, seedling establishment, wheat growth and litter incorporation. The three species differed substantially in their behavior and effect on plant establishment. Aporrectodea longa did not incorporate litter into the soil while Lumbricus terrestris (-69%) and Lumbricus rubellus friendoides (-75%) reduced the litter layer considerably during 9 weeks of incubation. Moreover, L. terrestris and L. rubellus friendoides buried more wheat seeds than A. longa. Fewer seeds germinated when buried by A. longa compared to L. terrestris.

"Direct and indirect effects of endogeic earthworms on plant seeds.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","The soil seed bank functions to escape unfavourable environmental conditions and seed predation. Anecic earthworms are increasingly recognised as important dispersers and predators of plant seeds. In contrast, the rote of the usually more abundant endogeic earthworms which live and feed in the soil on plant seeds is largely unknown. We tested whether (A) endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea rosea, Allolobophora chlorotica, Octolasion tyrtaeum, Aporrectodea caliginosa) ingest and digest grassland plant seeds (Phleum pratense, Bellis perennis, Trifolium repens, Poa trivialis, Plantago lanceolato, Medicago varia), (B) the passage of seeds through the gut of endogeic earthworms modifies seed germination, and (C) excreta (mucus and casts) of endogeic earthworms modify seed germination. As a reference effects of the well-studied anecic species Lumbricus terrestris were determined. Endogeic earthworms ingested and digested all of the studied plant seeds; however, both ingestion and digestion were earthworm and plant species specific. Moreover, passage through the gut of endogeic earthworms and their excreta modified plant seed germination (gut passage: B. perennis; excreta: Ph. pratense and Pl. lanceolato). The results indicate that endogeic earthworms may strongly impact the composition of the soil seed bank and, consequently, plant community assembly via direct and indirect effects on plant seeds. Since post-dispersal seed predation is a key factor for the structure of plant communities, with the effect on seed survival potentially exceeding that of pre-dispersal predation, seed predation and changes in germination of seeds by endogeic earthworm species is likely to drive plant community composition.","PEDOBIOLOGIA ","en",2009,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1016/j.pedobi.2008702","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2008.07.002","10.1111/gcb.13446","Germany","grassland field site of The Jena Experiment (Near the Saale river within the city boundaries of Jena in Thuringia)","Above and belowground interactions;Earthworm casts;Earthworm mucus;Grassland;Seed bank;The Jena Experiment","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworms as seedling predators: Importance of seeds and seedlings for earthworm nutrition.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Anecic earthworms have been shown to collect, concentrate and bury seeds in their burrows. Moreover, recent studies suggest that earthworms function as granivores and seedling herbivores thereby directly impacting plant community assembly. However, this has not been proven unequivocally. Further, it remains unclear if earthworms benefit from seed ingestion, i.e., if they assimilate seed carbon. We set up a series of three laboratory experiments in order to test the following hypotheses: (1) anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L) not only ingest seeds but also seedlings, (2) ingestion of seedlings is lower than that of seeds due to a 'size refuge' of seedlings (i.e., they are too big to be swallowed), and (3) seeds and seedlings contribute to earthworm nutrition. L terrestris readily consumed legume seedlings in the radicle stage, whereas legume seeds and seedlings in the cotyledon stage, and grass seeds and seedlings in the radicle and cotyledon stage were ingested in similar but lower amounts. Importantly, ingestion of seedlings, in contrast to seeds, was lethal for all plant species. Moreover, earthworm weight change varied with the functional identity and vitality of seeds and natural N-15 signatures in earthworm body tissue underlined the importance of seedlings for earthworm nutrition. The results indicate that the anecic earthworm L. terrestris indeed functions as a granivore and seedling herbivore. The selectivity in seedling ingestion points at the potential of direct earthworm effects on plant community assembly. Further, seeds and seedlings most likely contribute significantly to earthworm nutrition potentially explaining the collection and concentration of seeds by L terrestris in its middens and burrows; however, the present results call for experiments under more natural conditions.

"Interactive effects of global warming and “global worming” on the initial establishment of native and exotic herbaceous plant species.","Nico Eisenhauer","Peter B. Reich","The spread of exotic earthworms (‘worming’) and rising temperatures are expected to alter the biological, chemical and physical properties of many ecosystems, yet little is known about their potential interactive effects. We performed a laboratory microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of earthworms (anecic, endogeic, epigeic, or all three together) and 4°C warming on soil water content, litter turnover and seedling establishment of four native and four exotic herbaceous plant species.Warming and worming exerted independent as well as interactive effects on soil processes and plant dynamics. Warming reduced the water content of the upper soil layer, but only in the presence of earthworms. Litter removal increased in the presence of earthworms, the effect being most pronounced in the presence of anecic earthworms at ambient temperature. Exotic plant species were most influenced by earthworms (lower seedling number but higher biomass), whereas natives were most sensitive to warming (higher seedling number). This differential response resulted in significant interaction effects of earthworms and warming on abundance and richness of native relative to exotic plants as well as related shifts in plant species composition. Structural equation modeling allowed us to address possible mechanisms: direct effects of earthworms primarily affected exotic plants, whereas earthworms and warming indirectly and differentially affected native and exotic plants through changes in soil water content and surface litter.Invasive earthworms and warming are likely to interactively impact abiotic and biotic ecosystem properties. The invasion of epigeic and anecic species could select for plant species able to germinate on bare soil and tolerate drought, with the latter becoming more important in a warmer world. Thus earthworm invasion may result in simplified plant communities of increased susceptibility to the invasion of exotic plants.","Oikos","en",2011,"Nov","Germany","Australia","10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19807.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19807.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Cloquet Forestry Center","Keywords + : EUROPEAN EARTHWORM INVASION;NORTHERN HARDWOOD FORESTS;SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT;ENDOGEIC EARTHWORMS;ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;TEMPERATE;IMPACT;DECOMPOSITION;INVASIBILITY ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

The main criticism is that the previous focus of BEF experiments on random species assemblages within each level of diversity has ‘limited the understanding of how natural communities respond to biodiversity loss.’ He concludes that a broader spectrum of approaches considering both non‐random gains and losses of diversity is essential to advance this field of research. Wardle's paper is timely because of recent observations of frequent local and regional biodiversity changes across ecosystems. While we appreciate that new and complementary experimental approaches are required for advancing the field, we question criticisms regarding the validity of BEF experiments. Therefore, we respond by briefly reiterating previous arguments emphasizing the reasoning behind random species composition in BEF experiments. We describe how BEF experiments have identified important mechanisms that play a role in real world ecosystems, advancing our understanding of ecosystem responses to species gains and losses. We discuss recent examples where theory derived from BEF experiments enriched our understanding of the consequences of biodiversity changes in real world ecosystems and where comprehensive analyses and integrative modelling approaches confirmed patterns found in BEF experiments.

"Earthworms reduce biotic 15-Nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Holly A. Ewing","Esteban Suarez","Invasive exotic earthworms are significantly influencing understory community composition, soil, and ecosystem processes in northern hardwood forests in North America, but their effect on the retention of nitrogen (N) has been inconclusive. We examined this in two northern hardwood forest sites in New York state, USA through a tracer study. In both spring and fall, we added tracer amounts of N-15 as nitrate-to simulate atmospheric deposition-with the biologically less active tracer bromide (Br-) to areas both with and without large populations of invasive earthworms. Total recovery of N-15 was lower in earthworm-invaded plots, largely due to less retention in litter and upper soil horizons. Although the strong relationship between retention in the upper soil horizons and total N-15 recovery suggests that earthworm destruction of the forest floor may be one mechanism reducing the capacity for N retention, in some cases the mineral soil in earthworm-invaded plots retained substantial N. Biotic pools, particularly litter and microbial biomass, retained significantly less N-15 in earthworm-invaded plots than in their uninvaded counterparts. In plots invaded by earthworms, negative effects of earthworms on trees were revealed through root-uptake assays suggesting somewhat greater plant demand for ammonium in the spring and in lower N-15 recovery in maple seedlings the year following tracer addition. Although similar patterns of Br- movement across treatments suggested that earthworms had smaller effects on hydrologic tracer movement than expected, they appear to have significant effects on the biological processes that underlie N retention.","ECOSYSTEMS ","en",2015,"Mar","USA","Ecuador","10.1007/s10021-014-9831-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9831-z","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","ammonium;earthworms;hardwood forest;hydrology;invasive species;nitrate;nitrogen retention;nutrient cycling;microbes;soils","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworm effects on the incorporation of litter C and N into soil organic matter in a sugar maple forest.","Timothy J. Fahey","Patrick J. Bohlen","To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double‐labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22% ± 5.4% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm‐invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.","Ecological Applications","en",2013,"Jul ","USA","USA","10.1890/12-1760.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1760.1","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Cornell University's Arnot Forest located in Tompkins County, central New York State","aggregate;C:N ratio;decomposition;litter;Lumbricus;stoichiometry","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Carbon food resources of earthworms of different ecological groups as indicated by 13C compound-specific stable isotope analysis.","Olga Ferlian","Stefan Scheu","One of the challenges in soil ecology is to determine which organisms utilise stable forms of carbon in soil. Recent studies have indicated that endogeic earthworms are able to mobilise such stable carbon compounds. However, it remains unclear which particular compounds of stabilised carbon in soil are utilised by earthworms. Furthermore, current knowledge on ecological groups and food resources of earthworms is mainly based on direct observations, hence only reflecting what was ingested but not what was actually assimilated. We analysed seven earthworm species in beech and spruce forests and the associated litter, earthworm middens and soils, and employed compound-specific C-13 stable isotope analysis of fatty acids (FAs) to identify the origins of carbon resources of the earthworms. To relate food resources to carbon compounds of different stability, we analysed C-13 signatures of FAs of different particle size fractions. FA delta C-13 profiles of epigeic and endogeic earthworm species indicated assimilation of recently-fixed and recalcitrant carbon resources, respectively, whereas anecic earthworms assimilated a mixture of resources of different stability. Utilisation of carbon resources did not differ between beech and spruce forests. Endogeic species were associated with neutral lipids of soil particle size fractions with delta C-13 signatures of the bacterial marker a15:0 in earthworms resembling those of the clay fraction. This suggests that they assimilated carbon associated with small particle size fractions attached to clay humus complexes. The results showed that earthworms of different ecological groups utilise carbon pools of different origin and stability. As indicated by neutral lipids of bacterial origin, physically-stabilised organic matter appears to contribute to the nutrition of endogeic earthworms in forest systems.

"Linking direct and indirect pathways mediating earthworms, deer, and understory composition in Great Lakes forests.","Nicholas A. Fisichelli","Nico Eisenhauer","Ahistorical drivers such as nonnative invasive earthworms and high deer densities can have substantial impacts on ecosystem processes and plant community composition in temperate and boreal forests of North America. To assess the roles of earthworm disturbance, deer, and environmental factors in the understory, we sampled 125 mixed temperate-boreal forest sites across the western Great Lakes region. We utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to address the hypothesis that earthworm disturbance to the upper soil horizons and selective herbivory by deer are associated with depauperate understory plant communities dominated by graminoid and nonnative species. Evidence of earthworm activity was found at 93 % of our sites and 49 % had high to very high severity earthworm disturbance. The SEM fit the data well and indicated that widespread nonnative earthworm disturbance and high deer densities had similar magnitudes of impact on understory plant communities and that these impacts were partially mediated by environmental characteristics. One-third of the variation in earthworm disturbance was explained by soil pH, precipitation, and litter quality. Deer density and earthworm disturbance both increased graminoid cover while environmental variables showed direct and indirect relationships. For example, the positive relationship between temperature and graminoids was indirect through a positive temperature effect on deer density. This research characterizes an integrated set of key environmental variables driving earthworm disturbance and deer impacts on the forest understory, facilitating predictions of the locations and severity of future change in northern temperate and boreal forest ecosystems.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2012,"Dec","USA","Germany","10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-012-0350-6","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","125 forest sites in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan","Carex pensylvanica;Climate;Deer browsing;Earthworm invasion;Forest soils;Graminoid cover;Invasive plants;Understory plant community","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Importance of earthworm–seed interactions for the composition and structure of plant communities: A review.","Estelle Forey","Nico Eisenhauer","Soil seed bank composition and dynamics are crucial elements for the understanding of plant population and community ecology. Earthworms are increasingly recognized as important dispersers and predators of seeds. Through direct and indirect effects they influence either positively or negatively the establishment and survival of seeds and seedlings.  Seedling establishment is affected by a variety of earthworm-mediated mechanisms, such as selective seed ingestion and digestion, acceleration or deceleration of germination, and seed transport. Earthworm casts deposited on the soil surface and the entrance of earthworm burrows often contain viable seeds and constitute important regeneration niches for plant seedlings and therefore likely favour specific seed traits. However, the role of earthworms as seed dispersers, mediators of seed bank dynamics and seed predators has not been considered in concert. The overall effect of earthworms on plant communities remains little understood. Most knowledge is based on laboratory studies on temperate species and future work has to explore the biological significance of earthworm-seed interactions under more natural conditions.  In this review we summarize the current knowledge on earthworm-seed interactions and discuss factors determining these interactions. We highlight that this interaction may be an underappreciated, yet major driving force for the dynamics of soil seed banks and plant communities which most likely have experienced co-evolutionary processes. Despite the experimental bias, we hypothesize that the knowledge gathered in the present review is of crucial relevance for restoration and conservation ecology. For instance, as earthworms emerge as successful and ubiquitous invaders in various ecosystems, the summarized information might serve as a basis for realistic estimations and modelling of consequences on native plant communities. We depict promising directions of future research and point to the need to consider above- and belowground interactions in order to mechanistically understand the driving forces of plant community assembly.

"Earthworm invasion into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests.","Lee E. Frelich","Reich, Peter B.","Earthworms are keystone detritivores that can influence primary producers by changing seedbed conditions, soil characteristics, flow of water, nutrients and carbon, and plant-herbivore interactions. The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2006,"Sep","USA","Australia","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_5","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","New York forests, Minnesota forests","Aporrectodea;Dendrobaena;Exotic earthworm invasion;Lumbricus rubellus;Lumbricus terrestris;Keystone species;Minnesota forests;New York forests","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Trophic cascades, invasive species and body-size hierarchies interactively modulate climate change responses of ecotonal temperate–boreal forest.","Lee E. Frelich","Nico Eisenhauer","As the climate warms, boreal tree species are expected to be gradually replaced by temperate species within the southern boreal forest. Warming will be accompanied by changes in above- and below-ground consumers: large moose (Alces alces) replaced by smaller deer (Odocoileus virginianus) above-ground, and small detritivores replaced by larger exotic earthworms below-ground. These shifts may induce a cascade of ecological impacts across trophic levels that could alter the boreal to temperate forest transition. Deer are more likely to browse saplings of temperate tree species, and European earthworms favour seedlings of boreal tree species more than temperate species, potentially hindering the ability of temperate tree species to expand northwards. We hypothesize that warming-induced changes in consumers will lead to novel plant communities by changing the filter on plant species success, and that above- and below-ground cascades of trophic interactions will allow boreal tree species to persist during early phases of warming, leading to an abrupt change at a later time. The synthesis of evidence suggests that consumers can modify the climate change-induced transition of ecosystems.","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2012,"Nov","USA","USA","10.1098/rstb.2012235","https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0235","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","body mass;climate warming;exotic earthworms;trophic interactions;soil food webs","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Exploring carbon flow through the root channel in a temperate forest soil food web.","Kadeem J. Gilbert","Joseph B. Yavitt","Soil food webs play an important role in forest ecosystem functions that may be sensitive to global environmental change. We traced a pulse of C-13 from the root systems of young sugar maple stands through the soil food web to explore energy flow from roots to soil heterotrophs. Invasive earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the most highly-enriched taxa sampled, indicating that they were consuming significant quantities of live fine roots and mycorrhizae and assimilating significant amounts of root-derived C. Another invasive invertebrate, a weevil (Barypeithes pellucidus) also appeared to consume significant amounts of roots or root-derived C. High isotope enrichment in ants (Formicidae) may reflect their feeding on phloem-sucking coccids in soil. All the predators collected from the litter layer also exhibited high isotope enrichment, including the salamander Plethodon cinereus. Moreover, in the absence of invasive earthworms all the taxa of animals collected from surface soil were similarly highly-enriched in root-derived isotopes. The apparent importance of the root channel in supplying energy to the soil food web suggests that forest ecosystem functions could be highly sensitive to global changes that alter proportional tree C allocation belowground.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",2014,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1016/j.soilbio.2014505","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.05.005","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Arnot Forest, central New York","Ants;Carbon;Earthworms;Energy flow;Invasive species;Salamander","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Estimating local biodiversity change: a critique of papers claiming no net loss of local diversity.","Gonzalez, Andrew","Loreau, Michel","Global species extinction rates are orders of magnitude above the background rate documented in the fossil record. However, recent data syntheses have found mixed evidence for patterns of net species loss at local spatial scales. For example, two recent data meta-analyses have found that species richness is decreasing in some locations and is increasing in others. When these trends are combined, these papers argued there has been no net change in species richness, and suggested this pattern is globally representative of biodiversity change at local scales. Here we reanalyze results of these data syntheses and outline why this conclusion is unfounded. First, we show the datasets collated for these syntheses are spatially biased and not representative of the spatial distribution of species richness or the distribution of many primary drivers of biodiversity change. This casts doubt that their results are representative of global patterns. Second, we argue that detecting the trend in local species richness is very difficult with short time series and can lead to biased estimates of change. Reanalyses of the data detected a signal of study duration on biodiversity change, indicating net biodiversity loss is most apparent in studies of longer duration. Third, estimates of species richness change can be biased if species gains during post-disturbance recovery are included without also including species losses that occurred during the disturbance. Net species gains or losses should be assessed with respect to common baselines or reference communities. Ultimately, we need a globally coordinated effort to monitor biodiversity so that we can estimate and attribute human impacts as causes of biodiversity change. A combination of technologies will be needed to produce regularly updated global datasets of local biodiversity change to guide future policy. At this time the conclusion that there is no net change in local species richness is not the consensus state of knowledge.","ECOLOGY ","en",2016,"Aug","Canada","France","10.3410/f.726357299.793518743","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.726357299.793518743","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Anthropocene;baselines;biodiversity monitoring;extinction;invasion;meta-analysis;species richness;time series","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Earthworms increase soil microbial biomass carrying capacity and nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Peter M. Groffman","John C. Maerz","Earthworms have been shown to produce contrasting effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics. We measured soil C and N pools and processes and traced the flow of C-13 and N-15 from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter into soil microbial biomass and respirable C and mineralizable and inorganic N pools in mature northern hardwood forest plots with variable earthworm communities. Previous studies have shown that plots dominated by either Lumbricus rubellus or Lumbricus terrestris have markedly lower total soil C than uncolonized plots. Here we show that total soil N pools in earthworm colonized plots were reduced much less than C, but significantly so in plots dominated by contain L rubellus. Pools of microbial biomass C and N were higher in earthworm-colonized (especially those dominated by L rubellus) plots and more C-13 and N-15 were recovered in microbial biomass and less was recovered in mineralizable and inorganic N pools in these plots. These plots also had lower rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification than uncolonized reference plots. These results suggest that earthworm stimulation of microbial biomass and activity underlie depletion of soil C and retention and maintenance of soil N pools, at least in northern hardwood forests. Earthworms increase the carrying capacity of soil for microbial biomass and facilitate the flow of N from litter into stable soil organic matter. However, declines in soil C and C:N ratio may increase the potential for hydrologic and gaseous losses in earthworm-colonized sites under changing environmental conditions.

FRELICH","In the last decade the invasion of European earthworms into previously wormfree glaciated areas of North America has stimulated research into their impacts on native forest ecosystems in the region. As a first approximation, the impacts of invading earthworms are related to their biomass. However, direct measurements of biomass can be significantly affected by the moisture conditions under which the earthworms are collected and their relative gut contents. Ash-free dry mass is the best standardized measure of earthworm biomass, but requires the destruction of specimens.

"Effects of European earthworm invasion on soil characteristics in northern hardwood forests of Minnesota.","Cindy M. Hale","John Pastor","European earthworms are colonizing worm-free hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it's percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists. In the face of rapid change and multiple pressures on native forest ecosystems, the impacts of earthworm invasion on forest soil structure and function must be considered.","ECOSYSTEMS ","en",2005,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s10021-005-0066-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-005-0066-x","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chippewa National Forest of north-central Minnesota","earthworm invasion;northern hardwood forests;forest soils;Lumbricidae;exotic species invasion;ecosystem change;Acer saccharum ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Changes in hardwood forest understory plant communities in response to European earthworm invasions.","Cindy M. Hale","Peter B. Reich","European earthworms are colonizing earthworm-free northern hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion provide an opportunity to investigate the response of understory plant communities to earthworm invasion and whether the species composition of the earthworm community influences that response. Four sugar maple-dominated forest sites with active earthworm invasions were identified in the Chippewa National Forest in north central Minnesota, USA. In each site, we established a 30 X 150 m sample grid that spanned a visible leading edge of earthworm invasion and sampled earthworm populations and understory vegetation over four years. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with decreasing diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants in two of four study sites, and the abundance and density of tree seedlings decreased in three of four study sites. Sample points with the most diverse earthworm species assemblage, independent of biomass, had the lowest plant diversity. Changes in understory plant community composition were most affected by increasing biomass of the earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus. Where L. rubellus was absent there was a diverse community of native herbaceous plants, but where L. rubellus biomass reached its maximum, the herbaceous-plant community was dominated by Carex pensylvanica and Arisaema triphyllum and, in some cases, was completely absent. Evidence from these forest sites suggests that earthworm invasion can lead to dramatic changes in the understory community and that the nature of these changes is influenced by the species composition of the invading earthworm community.","ECOLOGY ","en",2006,"Jul","USA","Australia","10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1637:cihfup]2.co;2","https://www.jstor.org/stable/20069122","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chippewa National Forest of northern Minnesota","Acer saccharum;earthworm invasion;ecosystem change;exotic species invasion;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;tree seedlings;understory plant communities","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Hale","Susan Kalisz","Invasive plants impose novel selection pressures on naïve mutualistic interactions between native plants and their partners. As most plants critically rely on root fungal symbionts (RFSs) for soil resources, invaders that disrupt plant–RFS mutualisms can significantly depress native plant fitness. Here, we investigate the consequences of RFS mutualism disruption on native plant fitness in a glasshouse experiment with a forest invader that produces known anti‐fungal allelochemicals.Over 5 months, we regularly applied either green leaves of the allelopathic invader Alliaria petiolata, a nonsystemic fungicide to simulate A. petiolata's effects, or green leaves of nonallelopathic Hesperis matronalis (control) to pots containing the native Maianthemum racemosum and its RFSs. We repeatedly measured M. racemosum physiology and harvested plants periodically to assess carbon allocation.Alliaria petiolata and fungicide treatment effects were indistinguishable: we observed inhibition of the RFS soil hyphal network and significant reductions in M. racemosum physiology (photosynthesis, transpiration and conductance) and allocation (carbon storage, root biomass and asexual reproduction) in both treatments relative to the control.Our findings suggest a general mechanistic hypothesis for local extinction of native species in ecosystems challenged by allelopathic invaders: RFS mutualism disruption drives carbon stress, subsequent declines in native plant vigor, and, if chronic, declines in RFS‐dependent species abundance.","NEW PHYTOLOGIST ","en",2016,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1111/nph.13709","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.13709","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A ","N/A","allelopathy;Alliaria petiolata;carbon allocation;invasion;mutualism disruption;physiology;root fungal symbionts","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Exotic earthworm invasions in North America: ecological and policy implications: expanding global commerce may be increasing thelikelihood of exotic earthworm invasions, which could have negative implications for soil processes, other animal and plant species, and importation of certain pathogens.","PAUL F. HENDRIX","PATRICK J. BOHLEN","Earthworms are the best known and, in many situations, the most important animals that live in soil. Over 3500 earthworm species have been described worldwide, and it is estimated that further surveys will reveal this number to be much larger (Reynolds 1994, Fragoso et al. 1999). Distinct taxonomic groups of earthworms have arisen on every continent except Antarctica, and, through human transport, some groups have been distributed worldwide (Jamieson 1988, Reynolds 1994). The earthworm fauna of North America, including Canada, the continental United States, Mexico, and the islands of the Caribbean, consists of both native (Nearctic and Neotropical) and exotic species imported from many other regions of the world (Fender 1995, Fragoso et al. 1995, James 1995, Reynolds 1995). Any given locality may be inhabited by all native species, all exotic species, a combination of native and exotic species, or by no earthworms at all. Relative abundance and species composition of local fauna depend greatly on soil, climate, vegetation, topography, land use history, and especially on past invasions by exotic species.  Much of our knowledge of the earthworm fauna of North America is based on the work of Gordon E. Gates who, over a 60-year career, collected, described, and cataloged many of the currently recognized taxa, both native and exotic. Beginning in 1949, Gates collaborated with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), Bureau of Plant Quarantine (now Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS) to intercept oligochaetes found in “plant-associated materials” (mostly soil) being imported into the United States. Over a 32-year period (1950–1982), Gates (1976, 1982) acquired thousands of specimens and was able to determine that earthworms from all over the world were continually being imported. There is no reason to expect that this situation has changed since 1982. Indeed, as with exotic plants, fungi, and insects (Ruesink et al. 1995, Campbell 2001, Mack and Lonsdale 2001), growing global commerce may be increasing the likelihood that exotic earthworms will be introduced, both inadvertently with the importation of soil-containing materials (e.g., agricultural and horticultural products; Gates 1976, 1982, Boag and Yeates 2001, Ehrenfeld and Scott 2001) and intentionally for use in commercial applications (e.g., waste management and land bioremediation; Lee 1995, Edwards 1998). Because previous invasions by exotic earthworms have had significant impacts on soil processes and plant communities in native ecosystems (e.g., Alban and Berry 1994, Groffman and Bohlen 1999, Hale et al. 2000), there may be reason for concern over continued unrestricted importation of earthworms.  Regulatory activities have not been effective in reducing earthworm introductions in most areas of the world (Boag and Yeates 2001), probably because legal restrictions traditionally have not targeted earthworms or their propagules. There presently are no specific regulations concerning earthworm imports into the United States. Earthworm importations are regulated by APHIS under the Federal Plant Pest Act because of the potential for introduction of exotic plant pathogens in their guts and in soil that might accompany them (Tracy A. Horner, USDA APHIS, personal communication, 3 January 2002). The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe has heightened concern about earthworm imports, because some species may be vectors for that viral pathogen and others (Edwards and Bohlen 1996, Jamieson 2000). APHIS is now considering guidelines specifically for the importation of earthworms into the United States. In this article, which is derived from a report prepared recently for APHIS, we review the status of earthworms in North America, address problems associated with exotic earthworm invasions, and discuss criteria for assessing potential risks of earthworm importation.","BioScience","en",2002,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:eeiina]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052[0801:EEIINA]2.0.CO;2","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","North America ","N/A ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Interactions of an introduced shrub and introduced earthworms in an Illinois urban woodland: impact on leaf litter decomposition.","Liam Heneghan","Kristen Fagen","This study examined an 'invasional meltdown' where the invasion of a Midwestern, woodland by an exotic shrub (Rhamnus cathartica L.P. Mill) and the invasion by Eurasian earthworms facilitated one another. Using a litterbag approach, we examined mass loss of four substrates (R. cathartica, Acer saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba) along a gradient of Eurasian earthworm density and biomass throughout a 40.5 ha oak woodland in Glencoe, Illinois. Earthworm densities and biomass were greatest in patches where R. cathartica prevailed, and populations were lowest in an upland forest subcommunity within the woodland. At each of three points along this earthworm gradient, we placed replicated litterbags constructed either to permit or to deny access to the titter by earthworms. The treatments were, therefore, plot treatments (tow, medium and high earthworm density and biomass) and litterbag treatments (earthworm access and earthworm excluded). We found that earthworms promoted a very rapid loss of litter from R. cathartica bags. Within 3 months greater than 90% of this litter was Lost from the litterbags. Earthworm impacts on other substrates followed the sequence A. saccharum > Q. alba = Q. rubra. Effects of both litterbag and plot treatments were found within 3 months for A. saccharum but Quercus species were affected only after a year. We propose that the impact of earthworms on litter breakdown creates conditions that promote and sustain invasion by R. cathartica. Previous work has demonstrated that R. cathortica may alter soil properties in a way that promotes and sustains invasion by earthworms. These findings have implications for the restoration management of these systems, since the legacy of R. cathartica on soil properties and earthworm populations may persist even after the plant has been physically removed.

"Effects of earthworm invasion on plant species richness in northern hardwood forests.","ANDREW R. HOLDSWORTH","PETER B. REICH",": The invasion of non‐native earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) into a small number of intensively studied stands of northern hardwood forest has been linked to declines in plant diversity and the local extirpation of one threatened species. It is unknown, however, whether these changes have occurred across larger regions of hardwood forests, which plant species are most vulnerable, or with which earthworm species such changes are associated most closely. To address these issues we conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon national forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin (U.S.A.), respectively. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation, examined deer browse in 20 mature, sugar‐maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest, and analyzed the relationship between invasive earthworms and vascular plant species richness and composition. Invasion by Lumbricus was a strong indicator of reduced plant richness in both national forests. The mass of Lumbricus juveniles was significantly and negatively related to plant‐species richness in both forests. In addition, Lumbricus was a significant factor affecting plant richness in a full model that included multiple variables. In the Chequamegon National Forest earthworm mass was associated with higher sedge cover and lower cover of sugar maple seedlings and several forb species. The trends were similar but not as pronounced in Chippewa, perhaps due to lower deer densities and different earthworm species composition. Our results provide regional evidence that invasion by Lumbricus species may be an important mechanism in reduced plant‐species richness and changes in plant communities in mature forests dominated by sugar maples.","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY ","en",2007,"Aug","USA","Australia","10.1111/j.1523-1739.20070740.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00740.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chequamegon National Forest in Wisconsin (46°N, 91°W) and the Chippewa National Forest in Minnesota (47°N, 94°W)","deer herbivory;earthworm invasion;herbaceous layer;invasive species;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;plant-species richness;regional survey ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Regional extent of an ecosystem engineer: Earthworm invasion in northern hardwood forests.","Andrew R. Holdsworth","Peter B. Reich","The invasion of exotic earthworms into northern temperate and boreal forests previously devoid of earthworms is an important driver of ecosystem change. Earthworm invasion can cause significant changes in soil structure and communities, nutrient cycles, and the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants. However, the regional extent and patterns of this invasion are poorly known. We conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon National Forests, in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to measure the extent and patterns of earthworm invasion and their relationship to potential earthworm introduction sites. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation in 20 mature, sugar maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest and analyzed the relationship between the presence of five earthworm taxonomic groups, habitat variables, and distance to the nearest potential introduction site. Earthworm invasion was extensive but incomplete in the two national forests. Four of the six earthworm taxonomic groups occurred in 55–95% of transects; however 20% of all transects were invaded by only one taxonomic group that has relatively minor ecological effects. Earthworm taxonomic groups exhibited a similar sequence of invasion found in other studies:Dendrobaena&gt;Aporrectodea=Lumbricusjuveniles &gt;L. rubellus&gt;L. terrestris.Distance to the nearest road was the best predictor of earthworm invasion in Wisconsin while distance to the nearest cabin was the best predictor in Minnesota. These data allow us to make preliminary assessments of landscape patterns of earthworm invasion. As an example, we estimate that 82% of upland mesic hardwood stands in the Wisconsin region are likely invaded by most taxonomic groups while only 3% are unlikely to be invaded at present. Distance to roads and cabins provides a coarse‐scale predictor of earthworm invasion to focus stand‐level assessments that will help forest managers better understand current and potential forest conditions and identify uninvaded areas that could serve as important refugia for plant species threatened by earthworm invasion.","ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS ","en",2007,"Sep","USA","Australia","10.1890/05-2003.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-2003.1","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Chippewa and Chequamegon National Forests, in Minnesota and Wisconsin","Acer saccharum;earthworm invasion;ecosystem change;exotic species invasion extent;forest floor;Lumbricidae;northern hardwood forests;regional survey;roadless areas ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Uses and misuses of meta-analysis in plant ecology.","Julia Koricheva","Jessica Gurevitch","The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.Synthesis. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","en",2014,"Jul ","UK","USA","10.1111/1365-2745.12224","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12224","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","ecophysiology;meta-analysis;methodological quality;plant ecology;research synthesis;systematic review;vote counting ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Handbook of Meta-Analysis in Ecology and Evolution.","Julia Koricheva","K. Mengersen","Meta-analysis is a powerful statistical methodology for synthesizing research evidence across independent studies. This is the first comprehensive handbook of meta-analysis written specifically for ecologists and evolutionary biologists, and it provides an invaluable introduction for beginners as well as an up-to-date guide for experienced meta-analysts. The chapters walk readers through every step of meta-analysis, from problem formulation to the presentation of the results. The book identifies both the advantages of using meta-analysis for research synthesis and the potential pitfalls and limitations of meta-analysis (including when it should not be used). Different approaches to carrying out a meta-analysis are described, and include moment and least-square, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, all illustrated using worked examples based on real biological datasets. The book is tailored to the biological sciences, and will provide an invaluable text for practitioners from graduate students and senior scientists to policymakers in conservation and environmental management.","Book","en",2013,"Avr","UK","Australia","10.23943/princeton/978069113728501001","9780691137285","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A ","N/A","N/A ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Tree rings detect earthworm invasions and their effects in northern Hardwood forests.","Evan R. Larson","Peter B. Reich","Invasions of European earthworms into the forests of northern North America are causing dramatic changes in forest floor structure, vegetation communities, biogeochemical cycling, and site hydrology. However, long-term studies on the effects of invasive earthworms are limited because little data exist on the timing and rate of earthworm invasion at specific sites. We successfully used tree rings to identify the timing of earthworm invasions and the effects of earthworm activity on the Acer saccharum overstory of two recently invaded sites in northern Minnesota, thereby establishing a method to date earthworm invasions at other sites. In addition to identifying a tree-ring signature related to earthworm invasion, we found trees growing in invaded conditions were more sensitive to drought than trees growing in earthworm-free conditions. Increased drought sensitivity by A. saccharum has important implications for possible range shifts under climate change scenarios that include increasing drought frequency and severity.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2010,"May","USA","Australia","10.1007/s10530-009-9523-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-009-9523-3","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Northern Minnesota","Acer saccharum;Climate-tree growth relationship;Dendroecology;Earthworm invasion;European earthworms;Northern Minnesota ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Recent studies question these assumptions, however, as the traits and factors promoting successful introduced and native species can be similar.

In two case studies, we show that native and introduced species appear to follow the same 'rules' for becoming abundant.

"Earthworm invasions in northern hardwood forests: a rapid assessment method.","Scott R. Loss","Lee E. Frelich","Non-native earthworm invasions in north-temperate North America cause substantial adverse effects to hardwood forest ecosystems. Quantification of invasions is necessary for understanding impacts and identifying remnant earthworm-free areas, but existing sampling techniques are effort-intensive and/or environmentally damaging. We: (1) developed and applied a protocol that allows rapid classification of earthworm invasion into five stages based primarily on visual assessment of the forest floor, (2) sampled earthworms to test whether the protocol's stages can predict invasion by different species, and (3) assessed relationships between individual forest floor characteristics and presence of different earthworm species. Based on differences in biomass among points assigned to different stages, the 5-stage classification protocol accurately identified the onset of invasion by Lumbricus rubellus and Lumbricus terrestris, the species of greatest management concern in the northern Midwest. Except for middens as a predictor of L. terrestris presence, no forest floor variable was useful by itself for assessing invasions. The 5-stage protocol provides an efficient approach for assessing earthworm invasions in hardwood forests of the U.S. northern Midwest, can be implemented with minimal training, and serves as a blueprint for similar protocols in other regions experiencing earthworm invasions.","NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL ","en",2013,"Jan","USA","USA","10.3375/04333103","https://doi.org/10.3375/043.033.0103","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","hardwood forest, northern Midwest.","earthworm sampling methods;invasive earthworms;Lumbricus rubellus;Lumbricus terrestris;northern hardwood forests ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Hence, it remains highly controversial whether earthworms predominantly affect soils to act as a net source or sink of greenhouse gases.

"The influence of invasive earthworms on indigenous fauna in ecosystems previously uninhabited by earthworms.","Sonja Migge-Kleian","Liam Heneghan","Recent studies on earthworm invasion of North American soils report dramatic changes in soil structure, nutrient dynamics and plant communities in ecosystems historically free of earthworms. However, the direct and indirect impacts of earthworm invasions on animals have been largely ignored. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of earthworm invasion on other soil fauna, vertebrates as well as invertebrates.  Earthworm invasions can have positive effects on the abundance of other soil invertebrates, but such effects are often small, transient, and restricted to habitats with harsh climates or a long history of earthworm co-occurrence with other soil invertebrates. Middens and burrows can increase soil heterogeneity and create microhabitats with a larger pore size, high microbial biomass, and microclimates that are attractive to micro- and mesofauna. Under harsh climatic conditions, the aggregates formed by earthworms may increase the stability of soil microclimates. Positive effects can also be seen when comminution and mucus secretion increase the palatability of unpalatable organic material for microorganisms which are the main food of most micro- and mesofaunal groups. For larger invertebrates or small vertebrates, invasive earthworms may become important prey, with the potential to increase resource availability.  In the longer-term, the activity of invading earthworms can have a strong negative impact on indigenous faunal groups across multiple trophic levels. Evidence from field and laboratory studies indicates that the restructuring of soil layers, particularly the loss of organic horizons, physical disturbance to the soil, alteration of understory vegetation, and direct competition for food resources, lead directly and indirectly to significant declines in the abundance of soil micro- and mesofauna. Though studies of invasive earthworm impacts on the abundance of larger invertebrates or vertebrates are generally lacking, recent evidence suggests that reduced abundance of small soil fauna and alteration of soil microclimates may be contributing to declines in vertebrate fauna such as terrestrial salamanders. Preliminary evidence also suggests the potential for earthworm invasions to interact with other factors such as soil pollution, to negatively affect vertebrate populations.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","en",2006,"Sep","Germany","USA","10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-5429-7_8","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","western Canada, mid-western USA, north-eastern USA","biological invasion;Collembola disturbance;earthworm invasion;Oribatida review;soil fauna;Salamander ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasions: the trail behind, the path ahead, and a test of a disturbing idea.","Angela T. Moles","Fiona J. Thomson","1. We provide a brief overview of progress in our understanding of introduced plant species.2. Three main conclusions emerge from our review: (i) Many lines of research, including the search for traits that make species good invaders, or that make ecosystems susceptible to invasion, are yielding idiosyncratic results. To move forward, we advocate a more synthetic approach that incorporates a range of different types of information about the introduced species and the communities and habitats they are invading. (ii) Given the growing evidence for the adaptive capacity of both introduced species and recipient communities, we need to consider the implications of the long‐term presence of introduced species in our ecosystems. (iii) Several foundational ideas in invasion biology have become widely accepted without appropriate testing, or despite equivocal evidence from empirical tests. One such idea is the suggestion that disturbance facilitates invasion.3. We use data from 200 sites around the world to provide a broad test of the hypothesis that invasions are better predicted by a change in disturbance regime than by disturbance per se. Neither disturbance nor change in disturbance regime explained more than 7% of the variation in the % of cover or species richness contributed by introduced species. However, change in disturbance regime was a significantly better predictor than was disturbance per se, explaining approximately twice as much variation as did disturbance.4. Synthesis. Disturbance is a weak predictor of invasion. To increase predictive power, we need to consider multiple variables (both intrinsic and extrinsic to the site) simultaneously. Variables that describe the changes sites have undergone may be particularly informative.","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY ","en",2012,"Jan","Australia","New Zeland","10.1111/j.1365-2745.20111915.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01915.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","Argentina, Australia, Costa Rica, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Uganda and the United States of America","Forest, savana, woodland, grassland ","community susceptibility to invasion;disturbance evolution in introduced species;grazing invasion ecology;traits of successful aliens ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Here, we present a global meta‐analysis of experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average, human‐mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3% decline in species richness. Declines in species richness were highest for endotherms (33.2%), followed by producers (25.1%), and ectotherms (10.5%). Land‐use change and species invasions had the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8% and 23.7% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14%), nutrient addition (8.2%), and increases in temperature (3.6%). Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4%) than aquatic biomes (5.9%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land‐use change had the largest impact on species richness, whereas in the boreal forest and Northern temperate forests, species invasions had the largest impact on species richness. Along with revealing trends in changes in species richness for different disturbances, biomes, and taxa, our results also identify critical knowledge gaps for predicting the effects of human disturbance on Earth's biomes.","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION ","en",2014,"Jan","Canada","Canada","10.1002/ece3.909","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.909","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various","Various","Biodiversity loss;disturbance;extinction;habitat loss;species invasions;species richness ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Meta-analysis in biological sciences, especially in ecology and evolution (which we refer to as 'biological' meta-analysis) faces somewhat different methodological problems from its counterparts in medical and social sciences, where meta-analytic techniques were originally developed. The main reason for such differences is that biological meta-analysis often integrates complex data composed of multiple strata with, for example, different measurements and a variety of species. Here, we review methodological issues and advancements in biological meta-analysis, focusing on three topics: (1) non-independence arising from multiple effect sizes obtained in single studies and from phylogenetic relatedness, (2) detecting and accounting for heterogeneity, and (3) identifying publication bias and measuring its impact. We show how the marriage between mixed-effects (hierarchical/multilevel) models and phylogenetic comparative methods has resolved most of the issues under discussion. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of across-study and within-study meta-analysis, and propose how the use of within-study meta-analysis can improve many empirical studies typical of ecology and evolution.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",2012,"Sep","Australia","Brazil ","10.4324/9781410606747-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781410606747-9","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various","Various","Fixed-effect meta-analysis;Random-effects meta-analysis;Meta-regression;Egger's regression;I-2;Heterogeneity;Multivariate meta-analysis;Trim and fill method ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Earthworm invasion as the driving force behind plant invasion and community change in northeastern North American forests.","VICTORIA A. NUZZO","BERND BLOSSEY","Identification of factors that drive changes in plant community structure and contribute to decline and endangerment of native plant species is essential to the development of appropriate management strategies. Introduced species are assumed to be driving causes of shifts in native plant communities, but unequivocal evidence supporting this view is frequently lacking. We measured native vegetation, non‐native earthworm biomass, and leaf‐litter volume in 15 forests in the presence and absence of 3 non‐native plant species (Microstegium vimineum, Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii) to assess the general impact of non‐native plant and earthworm invasions on native plant communities in northeastern United States. Non‐native plant cover was positively correlated with total native plant cover and non‐native earthworm biomass. Earthworm biomass was negatively associated with cover of native woody and most herbaceous plants and with litter volume. Graminoid cover was positively associated with non‐native earthworm biomass and non‐native plant cover. These earthworm‐associated responses were detected at all sites despite differences in earthworm species and abundance, composition of the native plant community, identity of invasive plant species, and geographic region. These patterns suggest earthworm invasion, rather than non‐native plant invasion, is the driving force behind changes in forest plant communities in northeastern North America, including declines in native plant species, and earthworm invasions appear to facilitate plant invasions in these forests. Thus, a focus on management of invasive plant species may be insufficient to protect northeastern forest understory species.","CONSERVATION BIOLOGY ","en",2009,"Aug","USA","USA","10.1111/j.1523-1739.20091168.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01168.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","northeastern forests","Alliaria petiolata;Berberis thunbergii;earthworm invasion;facilitation;forest soils;invasive plants;leaf litter;Microstegium vimineum ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive earthworms shape forest seed bank composition.","Victoria Nuzzo","Bernd Blossey","To assess how non‐native earthworm and non‐native plant invasions shape soil seed bank composition in deciduous temperate forests.LocationNew York State, USA.MethodsWe recorded earthworm density, earthworm biomass and vegetation composition in 12 deciduous forests and subsequently collected soil cores and recorded emergence of plant species from the seed bank. We used path analysis to assess direct and indirect contributions of earthworms and vegetation composition (species richness and cover of native and non‐native plants) to the species richness and abundance of emergent seedlings.ResultsHigh earthworm populations were positively associated with increased species richness and seedling density of both native and non‐native plant species emerging from the seed bank. This relationship held for all life‐form groups, although the earthworm effect was indirect for non‐native graminoid abundance. Non‐native plants were positively correlated with earthworms and while they influenced both aboveground vegetation cover and species richness, they had no direct influence on emergent abundance or species richness.Main conclusionsOur results suggest that forest seed bank composition is strongly influenced by the presence and abundance of non‐native earthworms, and only weakly influenced by non‐native plants. Forest understorey recovery from seed banks is possible following earthworm invasion, but resulting communities bear little similarity to standing vegetation. Recovery of the full desirable and typical complement of aboveground vegetation will require input to seed banks by (1) fostering seed production of existing vegetation and/or (2) planting seed of desired species.

"Belowground interactions with aboveground consequences: Invasive earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.","Shishir Paudel","Scott R. Loss","A mounting body of research suggests that invasive nonnative earthworms substantially alter microbial communities, including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These changes to AMF can cascade to affect plant communities and vertebrate populations. Despite these research advances, relatively little is known about (1) the mechanisms behind earthworms' effects on AMF and (2) the factors that determine the outcomes of earthworm-AMF interactions (i.e., whether AMF abundance is increased or decreased and subsequent effects on plants). We predict that AMF-mediated effects of nonnative earthworms on ecosystems are nearly universal because (1) AMF are important components of most terrestrial ecosystems, (2) nonnative earthworms have become established in nearly every type of terrestrial ecosystem, and (3) nonnative earthworms, due to their burrowing and feeding behavior, greatly affect AMF with potentially profound concomitant effects on plant communities. We highlight the multiple direct and indirect effects of nonnative earthworms on plants and review what is currently known about the interaction between earthworms and AMF. We also illustrate how the effects of nonnative earthworms on plant-AMF mutualisms can alter the structure and stability of aboveground plant communities, as well as the vertebrate communities relying on these habitats. Integrative studies that assess the interactive effects of earthworms and AMF can provide new insights into the role that belowground ecosystem engineers play in altering aboveground ecological processes. Understanding these processes may improve our ability to predict the structure of plant and animal communities in earthworm-invaded regions and to develop management strategies that limit the numerous undesired impacts of earthworms.","ECOLOGY ","en",2016,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1890/15-1085.1","https://doi.org/10.1890/15-1085","10.1111/gcb.13446","N/A","N/A","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;disturbance;earthworm invasion;ecosystem engineers;plant community;plant-soil interactions ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Stands managed using uneven-aged silvicultural systems were not significantly different from any other treatment group, regardless of deer density, There was a significant management X deer X earthworm interaction, and earthworm density had a positive relationship with C. pensylvanica cover in most management history X deer density combinations. High levels of disturbance associated with at least two of the three factors considered in this study were associated with high C. pensylvanica cover, but patterns across any single variable were inconsistent.

"Invasive earthworms deplete key soil inorganic nutrients (Ca, Mg, K, and P) in a northern hardwood forest.","Kit Resner","Alex Blum","Hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region have evolved without earthworms since the Last Glacial Maximum, but are now being invaded by exotic earthworms introduced through agriculture, fishing, and logging. These exotic earthworms are known to increase soil mixing, affect soil carbon storage, and dramatically alter soil morphology. Here we show, using an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in northern Minnesota, that such disturbances by exotic earthworms profoundly affect inorganic nutrient cycles in soils. Soil nutrient elemental concentrations (Ca, Mg, K, and P) were normalized to biogeochemically inert Zr to quantify their losses and gains. This geochemical normalization revealed that elements were highly enriched in the A horizon of pre-invasion soils, suggesting tight biological recycling of the nutrients. In the early stage of invasion, epi-endogeic earthworm species appeared to have been responsible for further enriching the elements in the A horizon possibly by incorporating leaf organic matter (OM). The arrival of geophagous soil mixing endogeic earthworms, however, was associated with near complete losses of these enrichments, which was related to the loss of OM in soils. Our study highlights that elemental concentrations may not be sufficient to quantify biogeochemical effects of earthworms. The geochemical normalization approach, which has been widely used to study soil formation, may help when determining how invasive soil organisms affect soil elemental cycles. More generally, this approach has potential for much wider use in studies of belowground nutrient dynamics. The results support the existing ecological literature demonstrating that invasive earthworms may ultimately reduce productivity in formerly glaciated forests under climate change.","ECOSYSTEMS ","en",2015,"Jan","USA","Israel","10.1007/s10021-014-9814-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-014-9814-0","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","hardwood forests of the Great Lakes Region","hardwood forest;inorganic nutrient cycling;biological invasion;earthworms;geochemical mass balance;calcium;phosphorous;potassium;magnesium ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecosystem engineering effects on species diversity across ecosystems: a meta-analysis.","Gustavo Q. Romero","Julia Koricheva","Ecosystem engineering is increasingly recognized as a relevant ecological driver of diversity and community composition. Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta‐analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (&lt;1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for &gt;1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.","BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS ","en",2015,"Aug","Brazil","U.K","10.1111/brv.12138","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12138","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (122 studies)","Various","tropical versus temperate;facilitation;meta-analysis;ecosystem engineers;functional group;richness;diversity;indirect interactions;""stress-gradient hypothesis"";'metafor' ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States. Hence, researchers and managers should consider co-invasion of plants and earthworms when investigating invasibility and creating preemptive or post-invasion management plans.","OECOLOGIA","en",2014,"Dec","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-014-3175-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3175-4","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","forests of the Upper Midwest ","Light;Leaf litter;Invasibility;Lumbricus terrestris;Rhamnus cathartica ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Indirect and direct effects of exotic earthworms on soil nutrient and carbon pools in North American temperate forests.","Tara E. Sackett","Nathan Basiliko","Earthworm invasions in North American temperate forests cause considerable changes to soil and litter horizons, which can lead to changes in soil biogeochemistry and plant communities. These ecosystem changes have complex causal relationships, and the cascades of indirect effects from earthworm burrowing and feeding may have larger net effects on soil biogeochemistry than direct effects. In this study we partitioned the effects of earthworms on particular soil nutrient and carbon pools into direct and indirect effects. We defined direct effects as consisting of the association between the soil nutrient or carbon pool and earthworm biomass, whilst indirect effects included the impacts earthworms have on these soil pools through changing litter layer depth and soil chemical and biotic factors. We quantified these direct and indirect effects using a path analysis approach applied to data collected from 24 plots across an earthworm gradient in a northern hardwood forest stand in Ontario, Canada. As potential predictors, we measured earthworm functional group biomass, litter depth, microbial biomass, soil pH, texture, and organic matter. We related these predictors to extractable nutrient and carbon concentrations, including nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. We found few direct effects and primarily indirect effects of earthworms on the soil nutrient and carbon pools we measured. Endogeic earthworms had the strongest indirect effects via changes to pH, microbial biomass carbon, and proportion of soil organic matter. Anecic earthworms only indirectly affected soil and nutrient pools through changes in pH, and epigeic earthworms did not have either direct or indirect effects. Because endogeic earthworms had indirect effects through changing multiple soil factors, for some soil and nutrient pools these indirect effects augmented each other (primarily yielding negative effects), although in some cases indirect positive effects mitigated negative effects. Overall, the net effects of exotic earthworms on soil and nutrient pools were mostly negative. Of particular concern was the potential exacerbation by endogeic earthworms of phosphorus limitation in N-saturated forest systems, as well as carbon loss from mineral soils in addition to losses from the forest floor.","SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY ","en",2013,"Feb","Canada ","Canada","10.1016/j.soilbio.2012815","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.015","10.1111/gcb.13446","North America","temperate forests ","Exotic earthworms;Northern hardwood forest;Path analysis;Indirect effects;Nitrogen;Phosphorus;Carbon;Microbial biomass ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100.","Sala, OE","Wall, DH","Scenarios of changes in biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, vegetation, and Land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably wilt have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change.

"Positive interactions of nonindigenous species: invasional meltdown?","Daniel Simberloff"," Betsy Von Holle ","Study of interactions between pairs or larger groups of nonindigenous species has been subordinated in the literature to study of interactions between nonindigenous and native species. To the extent that interactions among introduced species are depicted at all, the emphasis has been on negative interactions, primarily resource competition and interference. However, a literature search reveals that introduced species frequently interact with one another and that facilitative interactions are at least as common as detrimental ones. The population significance of these interactions has rarely been determined, but a great variety of types of direct and indirect interactions among individuals of different nonindigenous species is observed, and many are plausibly believed to have consequences at the population level. In particular, mutualisms between plants and the animals that disperse and/or pollinate them and modification of habitat by both animals and plants seem common and often important in facilitating invasions. There is little evidence that interference among introduced species at levels currently observed significantly impedes further invasions, and synergistic interactions among invaders may well lead to accelerated impacts on native ecosystems – an invasional ‘meltdown’ process.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS","en",1999,"Mar","USA","USA","10.1111/ele.14127/v1/review1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.14127/v1/review1","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (we used a database)","Various","biotic resistance;dispersal agent;facilitation;habitat modification;indirect effects;mutualism;pollination;synergism ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

We assemble criteria for an appropriate index for the evenness of a biological sample. The most important criterion is that evenness should be independent of species richness. Twelve previously proposed indices and variants are considered, and two apparently new indices. Four indices are recommended as joint best buys:  A) If symmetry between minor and abundant species is not important, or if it is required that the index be less affected by minor species:  1) If it is essential that the index be able to reach a minimum of zero with any particular number of species, or if the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is important: E(1/D) (based on a common form of Simpson's index).  2) If good mid-range behaviour is desired: E' (proposed by Camargo).  B) If equal sensitivity to minor and abundant species is required:  1) If the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is not important, the clear winner is: E(Q) (a new index).  2) If the shape Is Important: E(var) (another new index).

"Invasive earthworm species and nitrogen cycling in remnant forest patches.","Katalin Szlavecz","Ian Yesilonis","Invasive non-native earthworms in forested areas of the northeastern United States are of concern since they have the potential to greatly change the nutrient dynamics of these ecosystems. Urban landscapes are particularly susceptible to non-native species invasions. In this study, we assessed earthworm communities and nitrogen transformations rates in urban and rural forest patches of the Greater Baltimore Metropolitan area, USA. We expected to observe a mixture of native and non-native species at the sites because the region has never been glaciated. The fauna was dominated by European lumbricids. Density and biomass varied between 5 and 288 ind m(-2) and 5.2 and 144.0 g m(-2), respectively, with urban forests having higher abundances than rural forests. In laboratory incubations, urban forest soils had higher potential N-transformation rates. Both N-mineralization and nitrification rates were positively correlated with soil pH. However, controls on earthworm communities and N-cycling are complex in the Baltimore region, because parent material and soil type also change along the urban-rural gradient. Further studies will separate out land use and inherent soil controls on earthworm populations and N-transformation rates.

"Belowground bud bank response to grazing under severe, short-term drought.","Benjamin L. VanderWeide","David C. Hartnett","While the effects of drought and grazing are often studied separately, these disturbances co-occur in grasslands worldwide and interactively influence population, community, and ecosystem processes. The effects of drought and grazing on the belowground bud bank may dictate the trajectory of community recovery because new shoots arise from belowground buds after disturbance in perennial grasslands. We therefore investigated the separate and interactive effects of severe drought and grazing on the belowground bud bank and aboveground vegetation in the tallgrass prairie of northeast Kansas, USA. Contrary to our expectations, we observed changes in community structure and declines in species richness both above and below ground in response to drought and grazing. We also hypothesized that drought would reduce bud bank density of all taxonomic groups, but found that grass bud and shoot densities remained constant across all drought and grazing treatment combinations. While sedge and forb bud and shoot densities were reduced by drought, only sedge bud density declined to a greater extent when grazed under drought conditions. Live rhizome biomass did not vary by treatment and was highly correlated with bud bank density, suggesting that bud demography is tightly linked to the production and senescence of rhizomes. Despite the effects of drought and grazing on aboveground net primary productivity and community structure, our work suggests that grasses stabilize tallgrass prairie plant communities because their rhizomes and associated buds persist through co-occurring disturbances.","OECOLOGIA ","en",2015,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1007/s00442-015-3249-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3249-y","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","northeast Kansas","Climate change;Ecological stability;Herbivory;Water stress;Tallgrass prairie ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Global meta-analysis reveals no net change in local-scale plant biodiversity over time.","Vellend, Mark","Wipf, Sonja","Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and > 16,000 nonexperimental, local- scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5- 261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species' invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ","en",2013,"Dec","Canada","Switzerland ","10.3410/f.718156878.793486656","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.718156878.793486656","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","spatial scale;permanent plots;ecosystem services ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Ecological impacts of invasive alien plants: a meta-analysis of their effects on species, communities and ecosystems.","Montserrat Vilà","Petr Pyšek","Biological invasions cause ecological and economic impacts across the globe. However, it is unclear whether there are strong patterns in terms of their major effects, how the vulnerability of different ecosystems varies and which ecosystem services are at greatest risk. We present a global meta-analysis of 199 articles reporting 1041 field studies that in total describe the impacts of 135 alien plant taxa on resident species, communities and ecosystems. Across studies, alien plants had a significant effect in 11 of 24 different types of impact assessed. The magnitude and direction of the impact varied both within and between different types of impact. On average, abundance and diversity of the resident species decreased in invaded sites, whereas primary production and several ecosystem processes were enhanced. While alien N-fixing species had greater impacts on N-cycling variables, they did not consistently affect other impact types. The magnitude of the impacts was not significantly different between island and mainland ecosystems. Overall, alien species impacts are heterogeneous and not unidirectional even within particular impact types. Our analysis also reveals that by the time changes in nutrient cycling are detected, major impacts on plant species and communities are likely to have already occurred.","ECOLOGY LETTERS ","en",2011,"Jul","Spain","Czechia ","10.1111/j.1461-0248.20111628.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01628.x","10.1111/gcb.13446","Various (199 articles, meta-analysis)","Various (1041 field studies)","Biological invasions;bottom-up effects;diversity;ecological complexity;ecosystem functioning;effect size;exotic species;island;N-fixing;weeds ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"
"Invasive species triggers a massive loss of ecosystem services through a trophic cascade.","Walsh, Jake R.","Vander Zanden, M. Jake ","Despite growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem services and the economic and ecological harm caused by invasive species, linkages between invasions, changes in ecosystem functioning, and in turn, provisioning of ecosystem services remain poorly documented and poorly understood. We evaluate the economic impacts of an invasion that cascaded through a food web to cause substantial declines inwater clarity, a valued ecosystem service. The predatory zooplankton, the spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus), invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1980s and has subsequently undergone secondary spread to inland lakes, including Lake Mendota (Wisconsin), in 2009. In Lake Mendota, Bythotrephes has reached unparalleled densities compared with in other lakes, decreasing biomass of the grazer Daphnia pulicaria and causing a decline in water clarity of nearly 1 m. Time series modeling revealed that the loss in water clarity, valued at US$140 million (US$640 per household), could be reversed by a 71% reduction in phosphorus loading. A phosphorus reduction of this magnitude is estimated to cost between US$86.5 million and US$163 million (US$430-US$810 per household). Estimates of the economic effects of Great Lakes invasive species may increase considerably if cases of secondary invasions into inland lakes, such as Lake Mendota, are included. Furthermore, such extreme cases of economic damages call for increased investment in the prevention and control of invasive species to better maximize the economic benefits of such programs. Our results highlight the need to more fully incorporate ecosystem services into our analysis of invasive species impacts, management, and public policy.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ","en",2016,"Apr","USA","USA","10.3410/f.726230400.793551925","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1600366113","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","Lake Mendota ","invasive species;ecosystem service;eutrophication;Bythotrephes;Daphnia ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

"Resident plant diversity and introduced earthworms have contrasting effects on the success of invasive plants.","Timothy J. S. Whitfeld","Peter B. Reich","Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that resident species diversity is an important driver of community invasibility. Through trait-based processes, plants in communities with high resident species diversity occupy a wider range of ecological niches and are more productive than low diversity communities, potentially reducing the opportunities for invasion through niche preemption. In terrestrial plant communities, biotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms can also affect invasibility by reducing leaf litter stocks and influencing soil conditions. In a greenhouse experiment, we simultaneously manipulated resident species diversity and earthworm presence to investigate independent and interactive effects of these two variables on the success of several invasive plants. Higher diversity of resident species was associated with lower biomass of invasives, with the effect mediated through resident species biomass. The presence of earthworms had a strong positive effect on the biomass of invasive species across all levels of resident species diversity and a weaker indirect negative effect via decreased soil moisture. Earthworms also weakened the positive correlation between resident species diversity and productivity. We did not observe any interactive effects of resident species biomass and earthworms on invasive species success. Partitioning the net biodiversity effect indicated that selection effects increased with resident species diversity whereas complementarity effects did not. Results suggest that managing for diverse forest communities may decrease the susceptibility of these communities to invasions. However, the presence of introduced earthworms in previously earthworm-free sites may undermine these efforts. Furthermore, future studies of plant community invasibility should account for the effects of introduced earthworms.","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS ","en",2014,"Oct","USA","Australia","10.1007/s10530-014-0657-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-014-0657-6","10.1111/gcb.13446","USA","field survey in the Eastern Broadleaf Forest province of Minnesota","Biodiversity-ecosystem function;Functional diversity;Invasibility;Lumbricus terrestris;Rhamnus cathartica ","introduced earthworms; plant communities; plant diversity; biological invasions; earthworm invasion; community composition; meta-analysis"

Food choice experiments with 10 plant species (3 grass spp., 4 non-leguminous herb spp., 3 leguminous spp.) showed that earthworms significantly selected between the offered seeds and generally preferred herbaceous species over grass species.
