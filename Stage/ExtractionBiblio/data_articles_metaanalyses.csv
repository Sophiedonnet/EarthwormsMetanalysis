1,"MA1","Influence of exotic earthworm invasion on soil organic matter, microbial biomass and denitrification potential in forest soils of the northeastern United States.","Amy E Burtelow","Peter M Groffman","Formerly glaciated regions of the northeastern United States have few native earthworm species and the region is dominated by exotic earthworms from Europe and Asia. Earthworms of the Asian Megascolecid genus Amynthas, common in many forests of the southeastern US, are invading new habitats in north of their reported range in the northeastern US. At the Cary Arboretum in Millbrook, NY (approximately 42° N latitude, 74° W longitude), we discovered distinct patches of forest soil invaded by Amynthas hawayanus which were adjacent to areas of forest soil with no earthworms. We sampled soil within and just outside of the worm patches to assess the influence of earthworm invasion on the following soil chemical and biological characteristics: soil NO−3 and NH+4 concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), readily-mineralizable C, organic matter content, pH and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA). Soil patches with earthworms had greatly increased fractions of active and readily-mineralizable soil organic matter compared with patches lacking worms. Readily-mineralizable and microbial biomass C, expressed per gram of soil organic matter, were 1.4-fold greater within the worm patches than outside the patches. Microbial biomass N per gram of organic matter was 2.4-fold greater, and DEA was 2.7-fold greater, in the worm patches than in surrounding soil. Earthworms apparently decreased the organic matter content of the O horizon by 36%. Our results strongly suggest that invasion of forests in the northeastern US by these exotic earthworms increases both C and N flux, with potentially important long-term consequences for nutrient cycling in these ecosystems.","Sep 1998","DOI: 10.1016/S0929-1393(98)00075-4","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222504320_Influence_of_exotic_earthworm_invasion_on_soil_organic_matter_microbial_biomass_and_denitrification_potential_in_forest_soils_of_the_northeastern_United_States?_sg=Yv_a-THpFLD4vDUrl0rXvw4YNA6TBSRqNj_obWyLYzEIp3c_WKtxs7crdoVE05VQwdF5S5LHlSvHMqs "
2,"MA1","Non-native earthworm influences on ectomycorrhizal colonization and growth of white spruce.","Erin K. Cameron","Erin M. Bayne","Exotic earthworms are entering previously uninhabited soils of boreal forests, their invasion largely facilitated through human activities. As ecosystem engineers, earthworms are capable of causing dramatic changes in above- and belowground forest composition, but whether they have the same effects in all forests remains unclear. Forest compositional changes caused by earthworms may be mediated by interactions between earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi. Specifically, tree seedling growth may be altered by the presence of exotic earthworms and their subsequent impact on mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we investigate the effects of exotic earthworms on ectomycorrhizal colonization and seedling growth of the conifer Picea glauca (white spruce) in gray luvisolic soils from the Boreal Plains. Anecic Lumbricus terrestris and epigeic Dendrobaena octaedra earthworms were added to mesocosms each containing a white spruce seedling in a greenhouse experiment. Impacts on the composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the mesocosms were determined using a combination of morphological and molecular techniques, and effects on seedling growth were assessed through above- and belowground measurements. The proportion of ectomycorrhizal root tips and ectomycorrhizal community composition did not vary as a function of earthworm species or density. Similarly, exotic earthworms had no significant effect on spruce seedling growth or survival.","Mar 2012","DOI: 10.2980/19-1-3478","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280989261_Non-Native_Earthworm_Influences_on_Ectomycorrhizal_Colonization_and_Growth_of_White_Spruce?_sg=pzRrZIYjbgFQCsvz09Ol-L1ejSQJVi1nswX8S0jb0dMER1vTvBujJZylabyNzgH2thtxPOVk8LfDlD8"

This paper presents results of a field cage experiment comparing the influences of three exotic European earthworm species (Aporrectodea longa, A. caliginosa and A. trapezoides) on lime incorporation and pasture production over two seasons, on two acidic soil types under pastures on the central tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. A. trapezoides was least effective in increasing pH of soil below 2.5 cm and survived poorly compared with A. caliginosa. The latter was most effective at 2.5–10 cm whilst A. longa was more effective at 10–15 cm depth. Similar complementary increases in the level of mineralisable nitrogen (MN) by both earthworm species were also observed. There was evidence suggesting that the survival of A. longa was improved by the presence of A. caliginosa. Earthworms improved pasture growth at only one site.","Jul 2004","DOI: 10.1016/j.apsoil.2003.12.004","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257382047_Complementary_ability_of_three_European_earthworms_Lumbricidae_to_bury_lime_and_increase_pasture_production_in_acidic_soils_of_south-eastern_Australia?_sg=Ua8BpdqBBRGjN8DdNf21oV7A8fddEVUdO7T4k5BQdF9DhT0xnOj4ahvoGlmNHoJpdRzR-G7q-BIGoDo"
4,"MA1","Amynthas agrestis invasion increases microbial biomass in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests.","Chih-Han Chang","Jeffrey S. Buyer","Earthworm species with different feeding, burrowing, and/or casting behaviors can lead to distinct microbial communities through complex direct and indirect processes. European earthworm invasion into temperate deciduous forests in North America has been shown to alter microbial biomass in the soil and reduce the fungi-to-bacteria ratios. It is unclear how changes in earthworm species composition due to interspecific competition may alter this dynamics, especially under the ongoing invasion by Asian Amynthas and Metaphire species. Furthermore, it is also poorly understood how interspecific interactions involving different species may have species-dependent, non-additive effects on different groups of soil microorganisms. By conducting a two-year field experiment in a deciduous forest in the Mid-Atlantic, we examined how the Asian species Amynthas agrestis and Amynthas corticis, the European species Lumbricus rubellus and Octolasion lacteum, and their interactions affect soil microbial communities, and tested the hypotheses that the Asian species and the interaction between the two European species negatively affect bacterial biomass. We showed that while A. corticis generally had no effect on soil microorganisms, A. agrestis had a positive effect on microbial biomass, primarily by increasing the biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Consistent with our hypothesis, the interaction between L. rubellus and O. lacteum had a negative effect on bacteria biomass. We concluded that the ongoing invasion of the Asian earthworm A. agrestis in forest soils and potential displacement of L. rubellus due to interspecific competition may lead to increased bacterial biomass through increasing resource availability and disrupting the interaction between L. rubellus and O. lacteum, potentially causing increased carbon mineralization and reducing soil carbon storage.","Nov 2017","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.07.018","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318718140_Amynthas_agrestis_invasion_increases_microbial_biomass_in_Mid-Atlantic_deciduous_forests?_sg=h75bsvQOrW9EcV6j_ItxwxtNj9cG7Bi_3coK_eWAxDEqMTAyGa8cgkae5bMCAYdVX4WiyzPC02gQ5bs"
5,"MA1","Community-specific impacts of exotic earthworm invasions on soil carbon dynamics in a sandy temperate forest.","Jasmine M. Crumsey","Knute J. Nadelhoffer","Exotic earthworm introductions can alter above- and belowground properties of temperate forests, but the net impacts on forest soil carbon (C) dynamics are poorly understood. We used a mesocosm experiment to examine the impacts of earthworm species belonging to three different ecological groups (Lumbricus terrestris [anecic], Aporrectodea trapezoides [endogeic], and Eisenia fetida [epigeic]) on C distributions and storage in reconstructed soil profiles from a sandy temperate forest soil by measuring CO2 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses, litter C incorporation into soil, and soil C storage with monospecific and species combinations as treatments. Soil CO2 loss was 30% greater from the Endogeic x Epigeic treatment than from controls (no earthworms) over the first 45 days; CO2 losses from monospecific treatments did not differ from controls. DOC losses were three orders of magnitude lower than CO2 losses, and were similar across earthworm community treatments. Communities with the anecic species accelerated litter C mass loss by 31-39% with differential mass loss of litter types (Acer rubrum > Populus grandidentata > Fagus grandifolia > Quercus rubra > or = Pinus strobus) indicative of leaf litter preference. Burrow system volume, continuity, and size distribution differed across earthworm treatments but did not affect cumulative CO2 or DOC losses. However, burrow system structure controlled vertical C redistribution by mediating the contributions of leaf litter to A-horizon C and N pools, as indicated by strong correlations between (1) subsurface vertical burrows made by anecic species, and accelerated leaf litter mass losses (with the exception of P. strobus); and (2) dense burrow networks in the A-horizon and the C and N properties of these pools. Final soil C storage was slightly lower in earthworm treatments, indicating that increased leaf litter C inputs into soil were more than offset by losses as CO2 and DOC across earthworm community treatments.","Dec 2013","DOI: 10.1890/12-1555.1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260560985_Community-specific_impacts_of_exotic_earthworm_invasions_on_soil_carbon_dynamics_in_a_sandy_temperate_forest?_sg=TwZmqg8S1rmzSe9JF2parYqqb3nMKwCTLLD7UkG3roL8hAbGcLFvHponVyF7M783iEeipZAqBW5RZuI"
6,"MA1","Exotic earthworm community composition interacts with soil texture to affect redistribution and retention of litter-derived C and N in northern temperate forest soils.","Jasmine M. Crumsey","Knute J. Nadelhoffer","Exotic earthworm impacts on temperate forest soils are influenced by earthworm community composition and are likely constrained by the degree of organic matter redistribution following earthworm introductions across different soil types; however, the relative importance of these factors remains unknown. We examined how exotic earthworm communities affected leaf litter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and transport in two Spodosols with contrasting textures and organic matter contents. In reconstructed soil mesocosms, we measured organic C pools, quantified 13C and 15N transport from isotopically labeled red maple (Acer rubrum) leaf litter, and linked leaf litter redistribution to sub-surface burrow system structures following 150-day incubations. Transport of C and N from surface litter into soil was greatest with multi-species earthworm communities, and A-horizon and burrow pools functioned as dominant sinks for this material. Litter-derived C:N recovery ratios of soil pools revealed higher retention of litter-derived N over litter-derived C; recovery of litter N (mg 15N m−2) transported from surface litter was greater in the sandy loam (98.2 ± 2.73 %) than in the sandy soil (66.2 ± 4.92 %) following earthworm community additions. Earthworm biomass was as a minor sink for litter C (mg 13C m−2) and N transported from surface litter (0.56 ± 0.13 and 2.26 ± 0.31 %, respectively). Recovery of litter-derived C and N in earthworm biomass increased with the degree of direct leaf litter consumption (A. trapezoides < E. fetida < L. terrestris). Surface-dwelling epigeic and mineral-soil dwelling endogeic species produced burrow systems with the highest volume, surface connectivity, and density in the A-horizon; these properties were associated with greater CO2 losses and with greater litter C and N transport into A-horizons and burrows. Burrow systems with high continuity and large burrows produced by vertical-burrowing anecic species were associated with greater litter C and N transport into B-horizons, and greater dissolved organic C leaching losses. This study shows that the degree of organic matter redistribution in temperate forest soils following earthworm introductions is directly related to earthworm community composition, while the preferential retention of N over C and the potential stabilization of this material is determined by soil type.","Dec 2015","DOI: 10.1007/s10533-015-0164-6","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284360123_Exotic_earthworm_community_composition_interacts_with_soil_texture_to_affect_redistribution_and_retention_of_litter-derived_C_and_N_in_northern_temperate_forest_soils?_sg=--Xz5BjAVMi-FAjEz0jtyfBdesNl_wVhxRxm8nKRTtshhppgaszt_AqZ3KNjL8LBifTzhEu6l0xfUoE"
7,"MA1","Earthworm-induced shifts in microbial diversity in soils with rare versus established invasive earthworm populations.","Alexandre B de Menezes","Peter H Thrall","European earthworms have colonised many parts of Australia, although their impact on soil microbial communities remains largely uncharacterised. An experiment was conducted to contrast the responses to Aporrectodea trapezoides introduction between soils from sites with established (Talmo, 64 A. trapezoides m⁻²) and rare (Glenrock, 0.6 A. trapezoides m⁻²) A. trapezoides populations. Our hypothesis was that earthworm introduction would lead to similar changes in bacterial communities in both soils. The effects of earthworm introduction (earthworm activity and cadaver decomposition) did not lead to a convergence of bacterial community composition between the two soils. However, in both soils the Firmicutes decreased in abundance and a common set of bacteria responded positively to earthworms. The increase in the abundance of Flavobacterium, Chitinophagaceae, Rhodocyclaceae and Sphingobacteriales were consistent with previous studies. Evidence for possible soil resistance to earthworms was observed, with lower earthworm survival in Glenrock microcosms coinciding with A. trapezoides rarity in this site, lower soil organic matter and clay content, and differences in the diversity and abundance of potential earthworm mutualist bacteria. These results suggest that while the impacts of earthworms vary between different soils, the consistent response of some bacteria may aid in predicting the impacts of earthworms on soil ecosystems.","Mar 2018","DOI: 10.1093/femsec/fiy051","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323947436_Earthworm-induced_shifts_in_microbial_diversity_in_soils_with_rare_versus_established_invasive_earthworm_populations?_sg=CbzTvyee1O9rRI79ugdfH9oEzIXtYmwOPNA2gkHj2YWHmtbfU15qXfRrLhfN5jUjnh250yhIpyD6-gQ "
8,"MA1","Exotic earthworms alter soil microbial community composition and function.","Mark A. Dempsey","Teri C. Balser","Exotic earthworms can profoundly alter soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in northern temperate forests, but the mechanisms explaining these responses are not well understood. We compared the soil microbial community (SMC) composition (measured as PLFAs) and enzyme activity between paired earthworm-invaded and earthworm-free plots in northern hardwood forests of New York, USA. We hypothesized that differences in SMCs and enzyme activity between plots would correspond with differences in soil C content and C:N ratios. Relative abundance of several bacterial (mostly gram-positive) PLFAs was higher and that of two fungal PLFAs was lower in earthworm compared to reference plots, largely because of earthworm incorporation of the organic horizon into mineral soil. In surface mineral soil earthworms increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and gram-positive bacterial PLFAs, and decreased fungal (mostly saprotrophic) and several bacterial (gram-negative and non-specific) PLFAs. Earthworms also increased the activities of cellulolytic relative to lignolytic enzymes in surface mineral soil, and the relationships between enzyme activities and components of the SMC suggest a substrate-mediated effect on the SMC and its metabolism of C. A highly significant relationship between components of the SMC and soil C:N also suggests that earthworms reduce soil C:N through functional and compositional shifts in the SMC. Finally, changes in AMF abundances were linked to phosphatase activity, suggesting that earthworms do not necessarily inhibit P-acquisition by AMF-associated plants in our study system. We conclude that the combined influence of earthworm-related changes in physical structure, accessibility and chemistry of organic matter, and relative abundance of certain groups of fungi and bacteria promote C metabolism, in particular by increasing the activities of cellulolytic vs. lignolytic enzymes.","Dec 2013","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.09.009","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273613855_Exotic_earthworms_alter_soil_microbial_community_composition_and_function?_sg=D4VMrOMKmC6Vw0PRa19bjDF14UoGAkuj9_pAsVopBM4fTVr3vyYu4-mX00Z7UGhHSbsd79ui0eBcZX0 "
9,"MA1","The wave towards a new steady state: effects of earthworm invasion on soil microbial functions.","Nico Eisenhauer","Lee E. Frelich","Earthworms are ecosystem engineers that cause a long cascade of ecological effects when they invade previously earthworm-free forests. However, the consequences of earthworm invasion for soil microbial functions are poorly understood. Here, we used two well-studied invasion fronts of European earthworms in northern North American hardwood forests previously devoid of earthworms in order to investigate three stages of earthworm invasion: uninvaded, the front of the leading edge of earthworm invasion and locations invaded at least 10years previously. Soil microbial biomass, respiration and metabolic quotient were measured. Earthworms had marked effects on soil microbial biomass (−42%) and respiration (−32%). At both sites, impacts were most pronounced at the leading edge of the invasion front, significantly decreasing soil microbial C use efficiency. This was most likely due to the disturbance of the soil microbial community caused by water stress. Based on these results, we hypothesize that effects of earthworm invasion on native soil ecosystem functioning are most pronounced at the peak of the invasion wave. After experiencing this wave, ecosystems possibly enter a new steady state with altered biotic compositions and functions.","Oct 2011","DOI: 10.1007/s10530-011-0053-4","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225359516_The_wave_towards_a_new_steady_state_Effects_of_earthworm_invasion_on_soil_microbial_functions?_sg=FYd8Zsryk_kSPiry0VAQ5H5xWXeUB83HYYI-kxfsT0YXSfaxFUYg-ccUV72QUw_bXHI2eef7RlxVOFE "
10,"MA1","Interactive effects of global warming and ‘global worming’ on the initial establishment of native and exotic herbaceous plant species.","Nico Eisenhauer","Peter B. Reich","The spread of exotic earthworms (‘worming’) and rising temperatures are expected to alter the biological, chemical and physical properties of many ecosystems, yet little is known about their potential interactive effects. We performed a laboratory microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of earthworms (anecic, endogeic, epigeic, or all three together) and 4°C warming on soil water content, litter turnover and seedling establishment of four native and four exotic herbaceous plant species. Warming and worming exerted independent as well as interactive effects on soil processes and plant dynamics. Warming reduced the water content of the upper soil layer, but only in the presence of earthworms. Litter removal increased in the presence of earthworms, the effect being most pronounced in the presence of anecic earthworms at ambient temperature. Exotic plant species were most influenced by earthworms (lower seedling number but higher biomass), whereas natives were most sensitive to warming (higher seedling number). This differential response resulted in significant interaction effects of earthworms and warming on abundance and richness of native relative to exotic plants as well as related shifts in plant species composition. Structural equation modeling allowed us to address possible mechanisms: direct effects of earthworms primarily affected exotic plants, whereas earthworms and warming indirectly and differentially affected native and exotic plants through changes in soil water content and surface litter. Invasive earthworms and warming are likely to interactively impact abiotic and biotic ecosystem properties. The invasion of epigeic and anecic species could select for plant species able to germinate on bare soil and tolerate drought, with the latter becoming more important in a warmer world. Thus earthworm invasion may result in simplified plant communities of increased susceptibility to the invasion of exotic plants.","Nov 2011","DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19807.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227762532_Interactive_effects_of_global_warming_and_%27global_worming%27_on_the_initial_establishment_of_native_and_exotic_herbaceous_plant_species?_sg=zS2MnUyhFCsKTm3a6Afc7jSQsBq2ZK2NcumopHgKkYqElzLZbi7uh54wbCCPG04Fgc1JY9ti12V5F9w"
11,"MA1","Invasion of a deciduous forest by earthworms: Changes in soil chemistry, microflora, microarthropods and vegetation.","Nico Eisenhauer","Stefan Scheu","Ecosystems of northern North America existed without earthworm fauna until European settlers arrived and introduced European species. The current extent of invasion by some of these species, Lumbricus terrestris L., Octolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (−75% and −22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.","May 2007","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.019","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222207820_Invasion_of_a_deciduous_forest_by_earthworms_Changes_in_soil_chemistry_microflora_microarthropods_and_vegetation?_sg=pIxJSEtSb9xVQQ-PFHqYd-t_e3IbjgKG6_rWgZFt4MiVgq6deqGcfbHc17ZNDsgrODvFOBu8A4g6hCI"
12,"MA1","Earthworm effects on the incorporation of litter C and N into soil organic matter in a sugar maple forest.","Timothy J. Fahey","Patrick J. Bohlen","To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double-labeled leaf litter with 13C and 15N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by Lumbricus terrestris or L. rubellus). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm-invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter-spring was highest in the L. terrestris (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both L. rubellus (R) and T plots. After two years, 22.0% +/- 5.4% of 13C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added 13C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no-worm (NW) plots (61-68%) than in R and T plots (20-29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of 15N than 13C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm-invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.","Jul 2013","DOI: 10.2307/23441616","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256084153_Earthworm_effects_on_the_incorporation_of_litter_C_and_N_into_soil_organic_matter_in_a_sugar_maple_forest?_sg=vPAapVGHuyKkHjlCx_QAbXyYX8wLcgU5yeKp63U0do9n4R7F63nPzlXZHh2XZ7upgwaTBsYLkdslA5Q"

Tiegs","Background/Question/Methods While invasive European earthworms belonging to the family Lumbricidae have known impacts on the temperate deciduous forests of North America, little is known about earthworms originating from other areas, despite increasingly common reports of thriving populations. Amynthas hilgendorfi, an Asian species with established populations in North American forests, is characterized by an annual life cycle, high metabolic and growth rates, and an ability to thrive at very high densities – traits that distinguish this species from many European earthworms. We hypothesized that the ecological impacts of this species on forest soils also differ, and here we present the results of field and laboratory experiments designed to 1) evaluate the potential impacts of A. hilgendorfi on forest-floor nutrient cycling and leaf-litter decomposition, 2) compare these impacts to those of a better-understood European species, Lumbricus rubellus,and 3) test for interactive effects between these two species. We conducted a replicated manipulative field experiment in which 1.5 m2 enclosures were treated with either A. hilgendorfi, L. rubellus, both species together, or no earthworm additions as a control. We also applied these same treatments to laboratory mesocosms, and in both experiments evaluated soil nitrate, ammonium, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations, and organic-matter decomposition. Results/Conclusions In the field we observed no difference in soil nitrate concentrations across earthworm treatments, while in laboratory mesocosms, nitrate concentrations in soil containing A. hilgendorfi was 43% greater than that mesocosms treated with L. rubellus,and almost double the nitrate concentration of earthworm-free mesocosms. Soil ammonium concentrations were greatest in field plots treated with A. hilgendorfi, but no differences were observed among treatments applied to laboratory mesocosms. A. hilgendorfi increased SRP concentrations relative to soils treated with L. rubellus and controls, in both the lab and the field. L. rubellus was associated with greater organic-matter decomposition rates than A. hilgendorfi in both the field and laboratory experiments. No interactive effects between the two species were apparent for any of the response variables we examined. Overall these results suggest that the effects of A. hilgendorfi on forest ecosystems differ from those of L. rubellus, and for nutrient mineralization in particular, can be more intense. Present knowledge of earthworm invasion ecology in North America is largely based on studies of European lumbricids, which may be inappropriate for understanding the impacts of earthworms of other families from other regions.","Aug 2010","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267283388_Effects_of_the_exotic_invasive_Asian_earthworm_Amynthas_hilgendorfi_on_forest_floor_processes?_sg=FTwOWGgS1BuGzx_ppR1Ffe1VTYy4Fuwwerz4vLYjAYH_ITgKySk5CJv4BLOw7G1qf3i-v8Oe0Qf8FTc"
14,"MA1","Exotic earthworm invasion and microbial biomass in temperate forest soils.","Peter M. Groffman","Timothy J. Fahey","Invasion of north temperate forest soils by exotic earthworms has the potential to alter microbial biomass and activity over large areas of North America. We measured the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in forest stands invaded by earthworms and in adjacent stands lacking earthworms in sugar maple-dominated forests in two locations in New York State, USA: one with a history of cultivation and thin organic surface soil horizons (forest floors) and the other with no history of cultivation and a thick (3–5 cm) forest floor. Earthworm invasion greatly reduced pools of microbial biomass in the forest floor and increased pools in the mineral soil. Enrichment of the mineral soil was much more marked at the site with thick forest floors. The increase in microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the mineral soil at this site was larger than the decrease in the forest floor, resulting in a net increase in total soil profile microbial biomass in the invaded plots. There was an increase in respiration in the mineral soil at both sites, which is consistent with a movement of organic matter and microbial biomass into the mineral soil. However, N-cycle processes (mineralization and nitrification) did not increase along with respiration. It is likely that the earthworm-induced input of C into the mineral soil created a microbial sink for N, preventing an increase in net mineralization and nitrification and conserving N in the soil profile.","Feb 2004","DOI: 10.1007/s10021-003-0129-9","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226878146_Exotic_Earthworm_Invasion_and_Microbial_Biomass_in_Temperate_Forest_Soils?_sg=WzjPjIqLETk8tqY2WzWCqrW_2a99NmKh4MjWENuOx1B4XBOqq-kiqbhKToTy0QA5gqhsOBq7pTo38oM"
15,"MA1","Earthworms increase soil microbial biomass carrying capacity and nitrogen retention in northern hardwood forests.","Peter M. Groffman","John C. Maerz","Earthworms have been shown to produce contrasting effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and dynamics. We measured soil C and N pools and processes and traced the flow of 13C and 15N from sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) litter into soil microbial biomass and respirable C and mineralizable and inorganic N pools in mature northern hardwood forest plots with variable earthworm communities. Previous studies have shown that plots dominated by either Lumbricus rubellus or Lumbricus terrestris have markedly lower total soil C than uncolonized plots. Here we show that total soil N pools in earthworm colonized plots were reduced much less than C, but significantly so in plots dominated by contain L. rubellus. Pools of microbial biomass C and N were higher in earthworm-colonized (especially those dominated by L. rubellus) plots and more 13C and 15N were recovered in microbial biomass and less was recovered in mineralizable and inorganic N pools in these plots. These plots also had lower rates of potential net N mineralization and nitrification than uncolonized reference plots. These results suggest that earthworm stimulation of microbial biomass and activity underlie depletion of soil C and retention and maintenance of soil N pools, at least in northern hardwood forests. Earthworms increase the carrying capacity of soil for microbial biomass and facilitate the flow of N from litter into stable soil organic matter. However, declines in soil C and C:N ratio may increase the potential for hydrologic and gaseous losses in earthworm-colonized sites under changing environmental conditions.","Apr 2015","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.03.025","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276170364_Earthworms_increase_soil_microbial_biomass_carrying_capacity_and_nitrogen_retention_in_northern_hardwood_forests?_sg=odYH6Q4LqALU8h-NVnqxpbWFT63LtfyCjCHP9-L59mnesHzvwcbiQ9M9N3gtPtYGEJJuJA9ko8Q9Orc"
16,"MA1","Effects of European earthworm invasion on soil characteristics in northern hardwood forests of Minnesota, USA","Cindy M. Hale","John Pastor","European earthworms are colonizing worm-free hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion in forests of northern Minnesota provide a rare opportunity to document changes in soil characteristics as earthworm invasions are occurring. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion in four northern hardwood stands, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with rapid disappearance of the O horizon. Concurrently, the thickness, bulk density and total soil organic matter content of the A horizon increased, and it’s percent organic matter and fine root density decreased. Different earthworm species assemblages influenced the magnitude and type of change in these soil parameters. Soil N and P availability were lower in plots with high earthworm biomass compared to plots with low worm biomass. Decreases in soil nitrogen availability associated with high earthworm biomass were reflected in decreased foliar nitrogen content for Carex pensylvanica, Acer saccharum and Asarum canadense but increased foliar N for Athyrium felix-femina. Overall, high earthworm biomass resulted in increased foliar carbon to nitrogen ratios. The effects of earthworm species assemblages on forest soil properties are related to their feeding and burrowing habits in addition to effects related to total biomass. The potential for large ecosystem consequences following exotic earthworm invasion has only recently been recognized by forest ecologists. In the face of rapid change and multiple pressures on native forest ecosystems, the impacts of earthworm invasion on forest soil structure and function must be considered.","Dec 2005","DOI: 10.1007/s10021-005-0066-x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226464435_Effects_of_European_Earthworm_Invasion_on_Soil_Characteristics_in_Northern_Hardwood_Forests_of_Minnesota_USA?_sg=9A8fkkAw20S1TRgKfXXfKQ3pL3qDQg8WFkD7KpwEEXof7N3rAzovPYvhzM8JOAX0p01LMsonLR1VvXE"

All the three earthworm species combined caused larger impacts on most variables measured than any single earthworm species. These included loss of O horizon mass, decreased thickness of the O horizon and increased thickness of the A horizon, and higher availability of N and P. The latter finding differs from field reports where nutrients were less available after invasion, and probably represents an initial transient increase in nutrient supply as earthworms consume and incorporate the O horizon into the A horizon. Earthworms also increased mortality of plants and decreased total mesocosm plant biomass, but here the impact of all the three earthworm species was no greater than that of L. terrestris and/or L. rubellus alone.

We hypothesized that earthworms, plants and the associated AMF exhibit different preferences for different forms of inorganic N (NH 4 + and NO 3 −), which could regulate the effect of earthworms and AMF interaction on plant N acquisition. We outlined three independent but complementary experiments to test this hypothesis in the context of exotic earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus. The earthworm is dominating the plantation forests in subtropical and tropical regions of China, which have their understory dominated by the fern Dicranopteris dichotoma. By employing an excised root 15 N incubation experiment and a field in situ 15 N experiment, we found that the fern prefers to use NH 4 + rather than NO 3 −. Then we did a 2 × 2 factorial microcosm experiment using AMF (Rhizophagus intraradices) and earthworms (P. corethrurus). The exotic earthworm increased soil NH 4 + concentration but did not affect soil NO 3 − concentration, while the AMF decreased soil NH 4 + concentration but had no effect on soil NO 3 − concentration. The increase in soil NH 4 + induced by the earthworms was efficiently utilized by the AMF, and significantly increased the total N uptake by the fern. In contrast, the AMF alone increased the N concentration of leaves and coarse roots, but not the total plant N uptake, primarily due to the lower levels of available NH 4 + compared with the earthworm treatments. The uninoculated fern did not benefit from the earthworm-induced increase in soil NH 4 + , suggesting that the root of the fern cannot access the 'NH 4 + hotspots' created by the earthworms. Our work suggests that successful cooperation of earthworms and AMF on plant N uptake depends on the correct match in N-form.","Jan 2018","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.10.038","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320892180_Cooperation_of_earthworm_and_arbuscular_mycorrhizae_enhanced_plant_N_uptake_by_balancing_absorption_and_supply_of_ammonia?_sg=mYbKqHu1CemOqk72XUexvv_A0URv1hFSkhQwcyGJIH4-SLrvYnGLtxDbxFLH_JkNRswFszRLf1NQF9w"

Invasive earthworms have the potential to alter soil C dynamics, though mechanisms and effects remain poorly understood. To investigate potential effects of invasive earthworms on forest C, the forest floor, mineral soil, fine root biomass, litterfall and microbial litter decay rates, and total soil respiration (TSR) over a full year were measured at an invaded and uninvaded deciduous forest site in southern Ontario. The uninvaded site was approximately 300 m from the invaded site and a distinct invasion front between sites was present. Along the invasion front, the biomass of the forest floor was negatively correlated with earthworm abundance and biomass. There was no significant difference between litterfall, microbial litter decay, and TSR between the invaded and uninvaded sites, but fine root biomass was approximately 30% lower at the invaded site. There was no significant difference in total soil C pools (0–30 cm) between the invaded and uninvaded sites. Despite profound impacts on forest floor soil C pools, earthworm invasion does not significantly increase TSR, most likely because increased heterotrophic respiration associated with earthworms is largely offset by a decrease in autotrophic respiration caused by lower fine root biomass.","Aug 2016","DOI: 10.1007/s10021-016-9977-y","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301316279_The_Impact_of_Invasive_Earthworms_on_Soil_Respiration_and_Soil_Carbon_Within_Temperate_Hardwood_Forests?_sg=9bLbHctLws1313fqYY_lh5J_ndqVI16DG26xC8TRo_uP2YOFWEiZBILlk47-MtiLVS9dgfXUe7iofO8"

We investigated whether interactions between native earthworms and a native rhizobium-inoculated leguminous shrub (Sophora microphylla) have a measurable effect on the mobility of nitrogen in an agricultural soil that has been nitrogen-enriched and colonised by exotic earthworms. Plants grew better in the presence of both native and exotic soil-burrowing earthworms. Rates of root nodulation were considerably enhanced in the presence of the native megascolecid anecic earthworm Maoridrilus transalpinus. This species consumed more organic matter in the presence of inoculated plants whilst marginally lowering soil pH and enhancing critical concentrations of nitrate, but also reducing nitrous oxide emissions. Earthworms raised dehydrogenase enzyme activity and microbial activity in soil, but this was not commensurate with rates of nodulation.

22,"MA1","Influence of earthworm invasion on soil microbial biomass and activity in a northern hardwood forest","X Li","X Li","Recent invasion and activity of exotic earthworms has profoundly altered the chemical and physical environment of surface soils in northern hardwood forests that previously had mor humus horizons. We investigated the influence of earthworm invasion on soil microbial biomass and activity in surface soils of Allegheny northern hardwood forests in central New York state. Earthworm activity in these sites had transformed surface soils with clear Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons (forest floor) overlying mineral soil, to more uniformly mixed organic-enriched A horizons. The highest concentrations of microbial biomass and activity occurred in the forest floor. Microbial biomass (assayed by chloroform fumigation–extraction) nearly doubled in surface (0–5cm) mineral soils in response to earthworm activity, an effect that corresponded directly to redistribution of organic matter from forest floor into the mineral soil. Microbial activity in surface mineral soils was even more sensitive to the presence of earthworms than microbial biomass. For example, substrate-induced respiration (or maximum initial respiratory rate, MIRR) was 6.7-fold greater, basal respiration was 5-fold greater, and microbial respiration per unit microbial biomass (metabolic quotient, qCO2) was almost 3-fold greater in surface mineral soils where earthworms were present than in earthworm-free sites. Of the activity indices, only MIRR was higher when expressed on an organic matter basis. Surface mineral soils where earthworms were present thus appear to retain a high proportion of the microbial biomass and activity found in mor organic horizons. Our findings suggest that earthworm activity stimulates the activity of soil microorganisms, probably by enhancing organic C availability via processing and mixing of litter. The relative pattern in microbial properties did not change over the growing season; however, there were some seasonal changes in the proportional differences between worm and no-worm soils. Our results indicate interactions among earthworms, organic matter, and soil microbial activity that should alter the carbon and nutrient balance of northern hardwood forest surface soils, relative to non-invaded soils.","Dec 2002","DOI: 10.1016/S0038-0717(02)00210-9","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240417367_Influence_of_earthworm_invasion_on_soil_microbial_biomass_and_activity_in_a_northern_hardwood_forest?_sg=xQhc6ZrVkJdLX4twRPkaBzh5piV0TEj-n3Pm8MlLMZ9GbS4h62ZltwJYb1zYYnwIHGPTUjqDhY8RdEE"

These earthworms bioturbate soils and may enhance physical interactions between minerals and organic matter (OM), thus affecting mineral sorption of carbon (C) which may affect C cycling. We quantitatively show how OM-mineral sorption and soil C inventories respond to exotic earthworms along an earthworm invasion chronosequence in a sugar maple forest in northern Minnesota. We hypothesized that mineral surface area in A horizons would increase as burrowing earthworms incorporated clay minerals from the B horizons and that enhanced contacts between OM and minerals would increase the OM sorption on mineral surfaces and mineral-associated C inventories in A horizons. Contrary to our hypotheses, mineral surface areas within A horizons were lowered because earthworm burrows only extended into the silt-rich loess that separated the A and clay-rich B horizons. Furthermore, where endogeic earthworms were present, a smaller fraction of mineral surface area was covered with OM. OM sorption on minerals in the A horizons shifted from a limitation of mineral surface availability to a limitation of OM availability within a decade after the arrival of endogeic earthworms. C-mineral sorption depends on earthworm consumption of OM as well as the composition and vertical distribution of minerals. This finding may thus explain the contradictory results reported in earlier investigations. Our results highlight the rapid and drastic effects of exotic earthworms on key ecosystem processes in deciduous forests in post-glacial settings.","Sep 2014","DOI: 10.1007/s10021-014-9809-x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266078585_Impact_of_Exotic_Earthworms_on_Organic_Carbon_Sorption_on_Mineral_Surfaces_and_Soil_Carbon_Inventories_in_a_Northern_Hardwood_Forest?_sg=OsjtRmQRktrJbITE-EXM8spoo2avtYQlJwkv1Ox0L2_jJq-BdmpLThK6TClbbW8qDXV-FNfZIJLvNj4"

Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (−75% and −22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.","May 2007","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.019","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222207820_Invasion_of_a_deciduous_forest_by_earthworms_Changes_in_soil_chemistry_microflora_microarthropods_and_vegetation?_sg=VCq21ykepzWo8mF_01p2wHDN8FtwvVADq663xW8X71pW98p0M_xfZ8oAeAKXP-zhGDkpIqAiW6xARq4"

We assessed survival, weight, burrowing and elemental concentrations for earthworms of a native unnamed Megascolecid species and of exotic Aporrectodea trapezoides in intact soil cores treated with an alkaline fly-ash at rates equivalent to 0, 5 and 25 t/ha over 6 weeks. Fly-ash did not affect survival, growth, number of burrows created or phosphorus solubilisation. Transfer of the earthworms to the new environment having vastly different pH from where they were collected, and possibly overcrowding, caused mortality in the soil cores for all treatments. A. trapezoides that had smaller individuals suffered mortality of 12% compared with 23% for the larger earthworms of Megascolecids. Earthworms of Megascolecids each increased their weight by 0.24g (25% of their original weight) while those of A. trapezoides lost 0.18g each (21% of their original weight). The difference in growth between the two earthworms was associated with grazing habit and probably with the large difference in the pH between source soil and that of the core soil. Megascolecids appeared to minimize grazing on ash-tainted soil and so ingested less Zn, which was more abundant in the fly-ash than in the soil, compared with A. trapezoides that had elevated concentration of this metal. Extractable P in the soil was increased with both species of earthworms, more so with the exotic species that solubilized 11% more P than the native Megascolecids. The benign influence of fly-ash on survival and growth of worms was associated with the pH of soil remaining unchanged during the six weeks of incubation.","May 2007","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.10.006","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229348862_Short-term_responses_of_two_contrasting_species_of_earthworms_in_an_agricultural_soil_amended_with_coal_fly-ash?_sg=e5SzEHWrA-IX3Ce2sjKcYHDw9yfLCopFRxXVwxdHz7wcui4RkVks4f6bnxPvHkL8pkSouz9vkGLrHCg"

Kolka","Invasive earthworms perturb natural forest ecosystems that initially developed without them, mainly by consuming the forest floor (an organic rich surficial soil horizon) and by mixing the upper parts of the soil. The fate of mercury (Hg) formerly contained in the forest floor is largely unknown. We used two mass balance approaches (simple mass balance and geochemical mass balance) to quantitatively assess the impact of exotic earthworms on Hg cycling in forest soils and the fate of Hg formerly contained in the forest floor. Two sets of soils, collected in 2009 and 2014 from an earthworm invasion transect in north central Minnesota, were analyzed in this study. We observed a substantial loss of Hg from the soil system following earthworm invasion. Mass balance calculations showed that 35 to 65 % of the forest floor Hg was retained in the underlying mineral soil with the remainder unaccounted. The most likely explanation for the loss of forest floor Hg from the system is microbially induced volatilization of Hg by soil microbes and possibly by earthworm gut microbes during consumption of the forest floor. Our calculations suggest that exotic earthworms can substantially perturb mercury cycling in the topsoil. Forest floor Hg may accumulate within worm biomass; however, this process can account for only a small fraction (1 to 3 %) of the lost Hg. Additionally, we calculated the mass balance of organic carbon (C) due to Hg’s high affinity for organic matter and found that a portion of the organic carbon also appears to be lost from the soil system.","May 2016","DOI: 10.1007/s11270-016-2885-0","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303553662_Impacts_of_Invasive_Earthworms_on_Soil_Mercury_Cycling_Two_Mass_Balance_Approaches_to_an_Earthworm_Invasion_in_a_Northern_Minnesota_Forest?_sg=Aw6ypUuIhxiwiyyIWi5Owj2LSO-otz6_Zv0c-u0f7ygZyCAoRWSJVicHtdc3H1fq8QVvOkn-H9u9R1w"

We conducted an earthworm-addition mesocosm experiment with before–after control-impact (BACI) design and a complementary field study in southern Wisconsin, USA, in 2014 to investigate effects of a newly discovered invasion of two Asian jumping worms (Amynthas agrestis and Amynthas tokioensis) on forest and prairie litter and soil nutrient pools. In both studies, A. agrestis and A. tokioensis substantially reduced surface litter (84–95 % decline in foliage litter mass) and increased total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus in the upper 0–5 cm of soils over the 4-month period from July through October. Soil inorganic nitrogen (ammonium– and nitrate–N) concentration increased across soil depths of 0–25 cm, with greater effects on nitrate–N. Dissolved organic carbon concentration also increased, e.g., 71–108 % increase in the mesocosm experiment. Effects were observed in both forest and prairie soils, with stronger effects in forests. Effects were most pronounced late in the growing season when earthworm biomass likely peaked.

At the same time, European earthworms are invading previously glaciated areas in this region, with largely anecdotal evidence suggesting they compound the negative effects of buckthorn and influence the invasibility of these forests. Germination and seedling establishment are important control points for colonization by any species, and manipulation of the conditions influencing these life history stages may provide insight into why invasive species are successful in some environments and not others. Using a greenhouse microcosm experiment, we examined the effects of important biotic and abiotic factors on the germination and seedling establishment of common buckthorn. We manipulated light levels, leaf litter depth and earthworm presence to investigate the independent and interactive effects of these treatments on buckthorn establishment. We found that light and leaf litter depth were significant predictors of buckthorn germination but that the presence of earthworms was the most important factor; earthworms interacted with light and leaf litter to increase the number and biomass of buckthorn across all treatments. Path analysis suggested both direct and moisture-mediated indirect mechanisms controlled these processes. The results suggest that the action of earthworms may provide a pathway through which buckthorn invades forests of the Upper Midwest United States.

Sackett","Nathan Basiliko","Earthworm invasions in North American temperate forests cause considerable changes to soil and litter horizons, which can lead to changes in soil biogeochemistry and plant communities. These ecosystem changes have complex causal relationships, and the cascades of indirect effects from earthworm burrowing and feeding may have larger net effects on soil biogeochemistry than direct effects. In this study we partitioned the effects of earthworms on particular soil nutrient and carbon pools into direct and indirect effects. We defined direct effects as consisting of the association between the soil nutrient or carbon pool and earthworm biomass, whilst indirect effects included the impacts earthworms have on these soil pools through changing litter layer depth and soil chemical and biotic factors. We quantified these direct and indirect effects using a path analysis approach applied to data collected from 24 plots across an earthworm gradient in a northern hardwood forest stand in Ontario, Canada. As potential predictors, we measured earthworm functional group biomass, litter depth, microbial biomass, soil pH, texture, and organic matter. We related these predictors to extractable nutrient and carbon concentrations, including nitrate/nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. We found few direct effects and primarily indirect effects of earthworms on the soil nutrient and carbon pools we measured. Endogeic earthworms had the strongest indirect effects via changes to pH, microbial biomass carbon, and proportion of soil organic matter. Anecic earthworms only indirectly affected soil and nutrient pools through changes in pH, and epigeic earthworms did not have either direct or indirect effects. Because endogeic earthworms had indirect effects through changing multiple soil factors, for some soil and nutrient pools these indirect effects augmented each other (primarily yielding negative effects), although in some cases indirect positive effects mitigated negative effects. Overall, the net effects of exotic earthworms on soil and nutrient pools were mostly negative. Of particular concern was the potential exacerbation by endogeic earthworms of phosphorus limitation in N-saturated forest systems, as well as carbon loss from mineral soils in addition to losses from the forest floor.","Feb 2013","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2012.08.015","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256854352_Indirect_and_direct_effects_of_exotic_earthworms_on_soil_nutrient_and_carbon_pools_in_North_American_temperate_forests?_sg=7C5KBobK55oCEw9sSn3FqwpSmfECaeHnGRWcvT77Ppzmn3Z-1nLVLFrzqTm8Pqh6UTnEkkoCL58xKDQ"

Most road sites (90%) and boat launches (80%) contained earthworms; half (50%) of low human impact sites contained earthworms. Distance to roads was the only significant factor in predicting earthworm occurrence; soil pH, soil moisture, leaf litter depth, and vegetation cover were not. The disparate distributions of these three species suggest that within the KNWR road construction and vehicle traffic played a role in dispersal of the widespread, abundant Dendrobaena octaedra and uncommon Dendrodrilus rubidus; bait abandonment appeared to be the primary method of introduction of Lumbricus terrestris. While the distribution of harmful anecic earthworms in KNWR is currently limited, the prohibition of Lumbricus spp. as bait within conservation units in Alaska may be warranted.","Jan 2016","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283351466_Distribution_and_abundance_of_exotic_earthworms_within_a_boreal_forest_system_in_southcentral_Alaska?_sg=r5di-abn1--vKZOPd47-1iOsJzCcaT8358gTSOQbZrCDWeBorKvdmN04fQrxD_8PVri2w5PYF4gvDfA"

Particularly exotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms potentially have profound impacts on community assembly and functioning. We investigated the impact of invasion by the lumbricid earthworms into an aspen forest of the Canadian Rocky Mountains on soil organic matter, microorganisms and microarthropod communities. Building on the results of previous studies in this forest, we expected positive effects of Lumbricus terrestris middens and negative effects of Octolasion tyrtaeum on soil biota (increase and decrease in soil nutrient concentrations, microbial parameters and soil microarthropod density and diversity, respectively). Further, we expected that earthworm effects change with time. Combined results of previous and the present study suggest a wavelike colonization pattern for Dendrobaena octaedra and O. tyrtaeum and that indeed the impact of earthworms on soil biota changed with time, likely due to changes in earthworm density. Unexpectedly, L. terrestris middens neither affected soil abiotic nor soil biotic properties. By contrast and in contrast to our hypothesis, carbon and nitrogen concentration and C‐to‐N ratio in deeper soil layers increased in presence of O. tyrtaeum , thereby likely enhancing nutrient availability for soil microorganisms and microarthropods. Even though the density of this endogeic species was rather low, presence of O. tyrtaeum resulted in increased densities of a number of microarthropod taxa and increased microarthropod diversity. The results suggest that at low density, invasive ecosystem engineers, such as O. tyrtaeum, cause disturbances of intermediate strength thereby beneficially affecting soil microorganisms and most microarthropods. This contrasts earlier effects during the wavelike invasion of O. tyrtaeum into the aspen forest when densities of O. tyrtaeum were high resulting in generally detrimental effects on soil biota. The results emphasize the nonlinearity of earthworm effects on abiotic and biotic soil properties and call for further long‐term investigations.","Jun 2009","DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17405.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202001036_Nonlinearity_of_effects_of_invasive_ecosystem_engineers_on_abiotic_soil_properties_and_soil_biota?_sg=bdtLg-XWl7v9qwv2i8Gwf3_Tlz1PUG9sZa_ZkT3Zb87xB2AEeTNb9liA5t8IqJRyAFQRjvA4IXvpArk"

Fisk","We compared the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) in northern hardwood forest plots invaded by exotic earthworms versus adjacent uninvaded reference plots. In three of the six pairs of plots, earthworm invasion resulted in significantly more total P in the upper 12 cm of soil. The finding of increased amounts of unavailable and occluded inorganic P forms in the invaded plots suggests that earthworm activity mobilized unweathered soil particles from deeper layers of the soil, increasing the stocks of total P in surface soils. In two pairs of plots, the earthworm-invaded soils had less total P than the reference soils. In these plots, earthworm activity resulted in augmented rates of P cycling and alteration of the physical structure of the soil that increased loss of P in leaching water, reducing the total amount of P. We hypothesize that the different effects of earthworm invasion on the soil P cycle result from unique characteristics of the ecological groups of earthworms dominating each site. The invaded plots with increased total P were dominated by the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris, a large earthworm that constructs deep, vertical burrows and is effective at moving soil materials from and to deeper layers of the profile. In contrast, the earthworm-invaded plots where the total P in the surface soil decreased were dominated by the epi-endogeic species L. rubellus, which feeds and lives in the upper organic layers of the soil. In these plots, earthworms significantly increased the amount of readily exchangeable P in the soil, increasing the loss of this element in leaching water.","Feb 2004","DOI: 10.1007/s10021-003-0128-x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225174209_Effects_of_Exotic_Earthworms_on_Soil_Phosphorus_Cycling_in_Two_Broadleaf_Temperate_Forests?_sg=U5SEZhvRzLvRBtgVJlHEEYwQZjg7O6TVpFkQXx_LvObST1Z54N_3EPmwIPsBCv7-zO9KkCVNeDigZ9E"

Bohlen","The invasion of North American forests by exotic earthworms is producing profound ecosystem changes, such as alterations in soil nutrient cycling, and redistribution and loss of soil organic matter. However, the present and future extent of these invasions is difficult to evaluate without a better understanding of the factors that control the distribution and abundance of earthworms in previously non-invaded habitats. In this study, the species composition and short-term dynamics of three exotic earthworm invasion fronts were studied at a northern hardwood forest in south-central New York State (USA). Belt transects were established at each of the three locations to sample from earthworm-invaded areas through transition zones and into invasion front areas. Lumbricus rubellus, L. terrestrisandOctolasion tyrtaeum were the most common species, but their distribution was not homogeneous along the transects. Whereas, L. rubellus was the only species with relatively high adult densities at transition zones and invasion fronts, L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum occurred mostly in the heavily earthworm-invaded areas and were rare at the invasion fronts. The density of earthworms along the transects decreased by 60–87 from June 2001 to October 2002 and then recovered in 2003 to values similar to those of 2001. This decrease was apparently caused by reduced recruitment of immature earthworms, probably related to the severe drought periods that the study area experienced in 2001 and 2002. Our data suggest that climate and topography, through their effects on soil moisture patterns, can be critical factors controlling the distribution and spread of exotic earthworms in previously non-invaded habitats.","Jun 2006","DOI: 10.1007/s10530-005-1196-y","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226560274_Spatial_and_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Exotic_Earthworm_Communities_Along_Invasion_Fronts_in_a_Temperate_Hardwood_Forest_in_South-Central_New_York_USA?_sg=h2AfGMunMuJEnHoGX92-2A0Wlb3-NXws0Gq6JKm-V4Pj1mK_dDblSEoOKAo3AMYtAA-4WPQyxxDLyA4"
37,"MA1","Resident plant diversity and introduced earthworms have contrasting effects on the success of invasive plants","Timothy J. S. Whitfeld","Peter B. Reich","Theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that resident species diversity is an important driver of community invasibility. Through trait-based processes, plants in communities with high resident species diversity occupy a wider range of ecological niches and are more productive than low diversity communities, potentially reducing the opportunities for invasion through niche preemption. In terrestrial plant communities, biotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms can also affect invasibility by reducing leaf litter stocks and influencing soil conditions. In a greenhouse experiment, we simultaneously manipulated resident species diversity and earthworm presence to investigate independent and interactive effects of these two variables on the success of several invasive plants. Higher diversity of resident species was associated with lower biomass of invasives, with the effect mediated through resident species biomass. The presence of earthworms had a strong positive effect on the biomass of invasive species across all levels of resident species diversity and a weaker indirect negative effect via decreased soil moisture. Earthworms also weakened the positive correlation between resident species diversity and productivity. We did not observe any interactive effects of resident species biomass and earthworms on invasive species success. Partitioning the net biodiversity effect indicated that selection effects increased with resident species diversity whereas complementarity effects did not. Results suggest that managing for diverse forest communities may decrease the susceptibility of these communities to invasions. However, the presence of introduced earthworms in previously earthworm-free sites may undermine these efforts. Furthermore, future studies of plant community invasibility should account for the effects of introduced earthworms.","Oct 2014","DOI: 10.1007/s10530-014-0657-6","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266793875_Resident_plant_diversity_and_introduced_earthworms_have_contrasting_effects_on_the_success_of_invasive_plants?_sg=mjbIVNZN8rtVwW9LXbELjDpx1p9vMm0hR_sqppjo9BjBZ0DayzjgS2l_dE47XolvdD-jIubSclUrSx0"

We measured earthworm abundance and biomass using hand-sorting and chemical extraction (allyl isothiocyanate) methods. They gave similar results, though there was evidence of size and species-specific biases. Abundance and biomass of the earthworms ranged from < 10 to > 100 earthworms center dot m(-2) and from < 10 to 125 g center dot m(-2), respectively, and were correlated with distance from a nearby lake (negatively) and soil pH (positively). The presence of earthworms was associated with a decrease in the mass and thickness and an increase in the ON quotient of the litter layer. There were no significant changes in C and N mass of the mineral soil between 0 and 10 cm, but the underlying layers (10-20 and 20-30 cm) in sites with > 10 earthworms center dot m(-2) showed significantly (p < 0.05) greater concentrations and masses of both C and N than did sites with < 10 earthworms center dot m(-2). The overall profile (litter plus soil to 30 cm) average C was 13.7 and 10.1 kg center dot m(-2) with and without earthworms, respectively, and the equivalent figures for N were 1.01 and 0.68 kg center dot m(-2). These results demonstrate that invasion of earthworms into deciduous forests affects both the litter and mineral soil, and sampling to a depth of 30 cm suggests that earthworm invasion (from < 10 to > 10 earthworms center dot m(-2)) may increase overall C and N.","Apr 2006","DOI: 10.1139/X06-016","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249535147_Exotic_earthworm_invasion_increases_soil_carbon_and_nitrogen_in_an_old-growth_forest_in_southern_Quebec?_sg=97eCdAHLViDbksBB1IEj5JDR4Ssa1x7bqx7BrGDK22-RO4MFxv0lEMYnNf41GMrXxRtjttLeX9t-Y3s"

Less is known about the impact of non-native earthworms, which are currently invading many northern forests in the USA and Canada, consuming the forest floor layer, and altering soil structure. I surveyed methane dynamics in earthworm impacted and control soils in central New York State for 1) concentrations in soil air spaces, 2) fluxes between soil and the atmosphere using static chambers in the field, and 3) oxidation kinetics in the laboratory. An inert tracer gas SF6 was used to assess earthworm impacts on soil gas permeability. I expected less consumption of atmospheric methane in earthworm-impacted soils for several reasons, including soil mixing that would disturb the fine zonation of methane-oxidizing bacteria typically found in the mineral soil. Results/Conclusions I found significantly greater concentrations of atmospheric methane within the profile of earthworm impacted soils than in controls, and sporadic measures of concentrations greater than atmospheric suggest that earthworms promote net methane production. Control soils were significantly more permeable to SF6, indicating that earthworm activity compacts forest soils. Consumption rates of atmospheric methane were statistically similar for earthworm impacted and control soils in the field. However, earthworm impacted soils consumed less methane when incubated in the laboratory, suggesting that the forest floor layer reduces the rate of atmospheric methane consumption in the field. The results extend the evidence that invasive earthworms in northern forests have an impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases to include atmospheric methane.","Aug 2013","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267289113_Atmospheric_methane_consumption_and_non-native_earthworms_in_northern_forest_soils?_sg=RU9XwDAyxiPkfsLkIBjQHSOefH-uUnbOKBlHB24JRfVTh5WQoqikcVT498Y7mfT7Uizb6eKiifm33E0"

However, the findings are controversial and raise new questions. Here we hypothesize that neither an increase in CO2 emission nor in stabilized carbon would entirely reflect the earthworms' contribution to net carbon sequestration. We show how two widespread earthworm invaders affect net carbon sequestration through impacts on the balance of carbon mineralization and carbon stabilization. Earthworms accelerate carbon activation and induce unequal amplification of carbon stabilization compared with carbon mineralization, which generates an earthworm-mediated 'carbon trap'. We introduce the new concept of sequestration quotient to quantify the unequal processes. The patterns of CO2 emission and net carbon sequestration are predictable by comparing sequestration quotient values between treatments with and without earthworms.

In a controlled experiment, an 82% decrease in the production of infested plants was suppressed when earthworms were present. Earthworms had no direct effect on nematode population size. In their presence, however, root biomass was not affected by nematodes and the expected inhibition of photosynthesis was suppressed. In the leaves, the expression of three stress-responsive genes (coding for lipoxygenase, phospholipase D and cysteine protease) was modulated by the presence of belowground invertebrate activities.

Especially in grasslands, earthworms are among the most important detritivore animals functioning as ecosystem engineers, playing a key role in nutrient cycling and affecting plant nutrition and growth. The objectives of the present greenhouse experiment were to quantify the effects of earthworms on grass-legume competition in model grassland systems at two harvesting dates - simulating the widespread biannual mowing regime in Central European grasslands. The presence of earthworms increased the productivity of grasses and legumes after 6 weeks but only that of grasses after another 10 weeks. In mixed treatments, the presence of grasses and earthworms decreased legume shoot biomass, the amount of nitrogen (N) in shoot tissue and the number of legume flowerheads while the presence of legumes and earthworms increased the amount of N in grass shoots and the infestation of grasses with aphids. Analyses of N-15/N-14 ratios indicate that. compared to legumes, grasses more efficiently exploit soil mineral N and benefit from legume presence through reduced ""intra-functional group"" competition. In contrast to previous experiments, we found no evidence for N transfer from legumes to grasses. However, legume presence improved total herbage and N yield. Earthworms likely modulate the competition between grasses and legumes by increasing soil N uptake by plants and thereby increasing the competitive strength of grasses. Earthworms function as essential driving agents of grass-legume associations by (I) increasing grass yield, (II) increasing the amount of N in grass hay, (III) increasing the infestation rate of grasses with aphids, and (IV) potentially reducing the attractiveness of grass-legume associations to pollinators.

We conducted a large‐scale field study to determine how the interactive effects of earthworms ( Aporrectodea caliginosa ) and summer drought affected plant communities containing barley ( Hordeum vulgare ), shepherd’s purse ( Capsella bursa‐pastoris ) and common groundsel ( Senecio vulgaris ), and how such effects then influenced populations of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and its parasitoid, Aphidius ervi . 2. Total biomass of plant communities decreased by around 25% with summer drought, but was increased by the presence of earthworms by over 11%. The effects of drought and earthworms on H. vulgare differed in monocultures and mixed plant communities. In monocultures, earthworms had the biggest impact, increasing plant biomass, but drought had the biggest effect in multi‐species communities, causing a decrease in biomass. 3. Drought had an extremely negative impact on S. vulgaris shoot and root biomass, but this was ameliorated in the roots when earthworms were present. Capsella bursa‐pastoris was not significantly affected by drought or earthworms. Drought caused a significant increase in shoot nitrogen concentrations in all plants, including H. vulgare (from 19.2 to 23.8 mg g ⁻¹ ). 4. In total, 35 234 aphids were recorded, of which 3936 were parasitized. Drought conditions reduced aphid abundance by over 50%. The interaction was moderated by earthworms, which caused further declines in R. padi populations under drought conditions, most notably in monocultures. 5. The plant‐mediated effects of drought and earthworms (negative and positive, respectively) on R. padi had cascading effects on the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi , which declined in abundance with reduced numbers of R. padi . In addition, drought had a negative impact on A. ervi abundance beyond its impacts on aphid density, suggesting reduced prey quality as well as quantity. 6. Synthesis . This study demonstrated the effect of predicted climate change (i.e. reduced summer rainfall) on plant‐mediated interactions between earthworms and above‐ground multitrophic groups.

In this study the individual effects of Aporrectodea rosea and Allolobophora chlorotica and the combined effects of A. rosea and A. chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis, and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, Lumbricus rubellus and S. mammalis on plant morphology and physiology and aphid development (nymphs day-1, fecundity and number of adults) were investigated. Plant growth was affected by the presence of A. rosea which caused increases in plant biomass, height of plant, leaf surface area and specific leaf area (SLA). Mean number of leaves per plant was unaffected by worm density. In contrast, increasing density of A. chlorotica had no effect on any aspect of plant performance. The combined effect of A. rosea and A. chlorotica resulted in a similar increase in plant biomass to A. rosea alone. While the combined effects of A. caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis caused increases in all plant parameters except leaf number. Additionally, the individual effect of A. rosea and the combined effects of A. caliginosa and S. mammalis, A. chlorotica & S. mammalis and A. rosea and A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis resulted in increased in leaf nitrogen concentration.

Decomposer-mediated changes in plant growth and insect pest performance were investigated in wheat–aphid model systems in the greenhouse. Three types of litter distribution were established: litter patch at the soil surface (simulating mulching), litter patch deeper in soil (simulating ploughing) and litter homogeneously mixed into soil (simulating disk cultivation). The litter was labelled with 15N to follow the mineralization and uptake of nutrients by the plants. Earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and Collembola (Protaphorura armata) were included as representatives of major functional groups of decomposers. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was planted and aphids (Rhophalosiphum padi) were introduced to leaves as one of the most important pests. Earthworms, Collembola and litter distribution affected plant growth, N acquisition and aphid development in an interactive way. Earthworms and Collembola increased biomass of seeds, shoots and roots of wheat. Increased plant growth by earthworms and Collembola was mainly due to increased transfer of N from soil (rather than litter) into plants. Despite increasing plant growth, earthworms reduced aphid reproduction. Aphid reproduction was not correlated closely with plant N concentrations, but rather with the concentration of litter N in wheat. Unexpectedly, both Collembola and earthworms predominantly affected the mobilization of N from soil organic matter, and by altering the distribution of litter earthworms reduced infestation of crops by aphids via reducing plant capture of litter N, in particular if the litter was concentrated deeper in soil. The results suggest that management practices stimulating a continuous moderate increase in nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter rather than nutrient flushes from decomposing fresh organic matter result in maximum plant growth with minimum plant pest infestation.","Oct 2008","DOI: 10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51428073_Earthworms_Collembola_and_residue_management_change_wheat_Triticum_aestivum_and_herbivore_pest_performance_Aphidina_Rhophalosiphum_padi?_sg=85R82Th0MnfRittJD-3Vx0BuXvqBZRON9oFm9dLzLFNJYUMqDoo7qRpTh69RnevSK9Pm14sr5HeRn6w"

We measured root and shoot biomass and determined plant community composition and densities of aphids, parasitoids and nematodes. Living locusts decreased total shoot and root biomass in the mesocosms, whereas living earthworms enhanced total root biomass. Cadavers of both invertebrates strongly increased total root and shoot biomass, and changed the plant community composition mainly via enhanced growth of grasses. Earthworm cadavers affected plant biomass and community composition more strongly than their living counterparts, while this was reversed for locusts. Structural equation models showed that aphids and parasitoids were influenced via changes in plant community composition. Nematode densities in the soil, especially those of bacterivorous and entomopathogenic nematodes, were strongly increased by dead invertebrates, but unaffected by living ones. We conclude that effects of invertebrates on plant growth and densities of AG and BG organisms strongly depend on whether the invertebrates are dead or alive. Remarkably, invertebrate cadavers may inflict even stronger effects than their living counterparts. Hence, our study reveals an important, but often neglected, role of animal cadavers in AG–BG studies.","Oct 2016","DOI: 10.1111/oik.03734","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309139175_After-life_effects_Living_and_dead_invertebrates_differentially_affect_plants_and_their_associated_above-_and_belowground_multitrophic_communities?_sg=Ii1w051AZzgWXFpHiHxZHyO5i6V8QR2ZuCtSKx-hHELO9Hyj36KtS0Ds4SWMsKIOEBvF9esPTIPbQ6o"

Earthworms are known to closely interact with above-ground and under-ground soil biota and particularly with plants and microfaunal communities. This study was aimed at investigating, under greenhouse conditions, the effects of the earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus on banana growth and nutrient uptake, and assessing the influences of this earthworm on the development of an inoculated population of R. similis. Six-week-old tissue culture banana plants were submitted to four treatments: with P. corethrurus, R. similis, P. corethrurus+R. similis, and a control with no earthworms or nematodes. At the end of the experiment, the P. corethrurus treatments showed significantly higher leaf surface areas, shoot dry root weights, and root fresh weights than those without earthworms. This root growth enhancement probably contributed to the evident but non-significant decrease in the density of nematodes in the roots, even though earthworms did not reduce the total number of nematodes per whole root system. Moreover, the presence of earthworms slightly alleviated the severity of root damage. N bioavailability in the soil, along with N, Ca, and Mg content of banana plants, were also significantly increased in the presence of earthworms. Our results demonstrated that banana plant growth and nutrition were positively influenced by earthworms. Cropping practices that boost the development of earthworm communities in soil should therefore be promoted to enhance sustainability and to naturally alleviate nematode impact.","Oct 2007","DOI: 10.1016/j.pedobi.2007.05.004","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248907452_Effects_of_the_earthworm_Pontoscolex_corethrurus_on_banana_plants_infected_or_not_with_the_plant-parasitic_nematode_Radopholus_similis?_sg=InO7-aReFMPIw5VbsBbdOhRU4kYRonnG-qOSrQHQA12JED8e8tUhO0z5YOPXKzU4T1qriAg2WsW6i9s"

In contrast, effects of soil organisms, acting alone or in concert, on allocation patterns are less well understood. We investigated separate and combined effects of the endogeic earthworm species Aporrectodea caliginosa and the root feeding nematode species Pratylenchus penetrans and Meloidogyne incognita on plant responses including growth and defence metabolite concentrations in leaves of white mustard, Sinapis alba. Soil biota had a strong impact on plant traits, with the intensity varying due to species combinations. Nematode infestation reduced shoot biomass and nitrogen concentration but only in the absence of earthworms. Earthworms likely counteracted the negative effects of nematodes. Infestation with the migratory lesion-nematode P. penetrans combined with earthworms led to increased root length. Earthworm biomass increased in the presence of this species, indicating that these nematodes increased the food resources of earthworms-presumably dead and decaying roots. Nitrogen-based defence compounds, i.e. glucosinolates, did not correlate with nitrogen levels. In the presence of earthworms, concentrations of aromatic glucosinolates in leaves were significantly increased. In contrast, infection with P. penetrans strongly decreased concentrations of glucosinolates (up to 81%). Infestation with the sedentary nematode M. incognita induced aromatic glucosinolates by more than 50% but only when earthworms were also present. Myrosinase activities, glucosinolate-hydrolysing enzymes, were unaffected by nematodes but reduced in the presence of earthworms. Our results document that root-feeding nematodes elicit systemic plant responses in defence metabolites, with the responses varying drastically with nematode species of different functional groups. Furthermore, systemic plant responses are also altered by decomposer animals, such as earthworms, challenging the assumption that induction of plant responses including defence traits is restricted to herbivores. Soil animals even interact and modulate the individual effects on plant growth and plant defence, thereby likely also influencing shoot herbivore attack.","Apr 2009","DOI: 10.1007/s00442-009-1306-0","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24147432_Decomposers_and_root_feeders_interactively_affect_plant_defence_in_Sinapis_alba?_sg=kaXADBoriNeZeDmn5_kXd5gy3KGJvhnOpXzU3oR2SYXVdIxMcYNrPXggiGxIdlvu2UJUPhGWCDdrr4w"

In a microcosm study we asked whether changes in the performance of two plant species, Cardamine hirsuta L. and Veronica persica Poiret., arising from the activity of various earthworm communities influenced the consumption rate and development of a leaf‐chewer, Mamestra brassicae L. Earthworms increased soil nitrate and foliar nitrogen concentrations. There was no associated increase in plant biomass. There was no significant effect of earthworm treatment on the biomass of M. brassicae larvae. However, highest larval mortality occurred in microcosms without earthworms, while the proportion of larvae that had reached the final instar was lowest. In a 24 h feeding trial, the consumption rate of V. persica foliage by M. brassicae was higher when plants were grown in soil containing earthworms. The complexity of earthworm communities did not affect M. brassicae consumption rates and consequent development.

However, these complex interactions are seldomly investigated simultaneously. In a factorial common garden experiment we tested single and combined effects of decomposers, root herbivores and leaf herbivores on the growth, flower visitation, and abundance of naturally colonizing aphids and parasitoids on wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis). We found that the individual presence of either root herbivores or decomposers resulted in increased aphid abundance, demonstrating that the same aboveground plant–insect interaction can be released by different belowground processes. Enhanced aphid densities caused higher numbers of parasitoids. Furthermore, decomposers increased plant growth and plant fitness (measured as the number of seeds produced), indicating that mustard may benefit from nutrients provided by decomposers, regardless whether plants are attacked by root herbivores or leaf herbivores, or both simultaneously. More flower visits were observed in plants attacked by root herbivores but without leaf herbivores than in plants with both herbivores, suggesting that root herbivory can modify flower attractivity to pollinators. Our results suggest that patterns in plant–insect interactions above the ground are not only affected by aboveground factors but also by a wealth of different belowground processes mediated by the plant.","Mar 2005","DOI: 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2005.13664.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227601147_Effects_of_decomposers_and_herbivores_on_plant_performance_and_aboveground_plant-insect_interactions?_sg=HHexd4JTJkd_8p9NctGHqPHe9qgCQ4zgs7IInR8OMZzDVYkf1HoXFhvfTeE3XJGCEzPjXXifA8pZ1DA"

Hefin Jones","Effects of Collembola (Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus scotarius) and earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion tyrtaeum) on the growth of two plant species from different functional groups (Poa annua and Trifolium repens), and on the development of aphids (Myzus persicae) were investigated in a laboratory experiment lasting 20 weeks. Using soil from a fallow site which had been set aside for about 15 years, we expected that nitrogen would be of limited supply to plants and hypothesized that the soil animals studied, particularly earthworms, would increase nutrient availability to plants and thereby also modify aphid reproduction and development. Plant growth was modified strongly by the presence of soil animals. Earthworms caused a more than twofold increase in shoot and root mass of P. annua but increased that of T. repens by only 18% and 6%, respectively. However, earthworms neither affected plant shoot/root ratio nor the nitrogen concentration in plant tissue. In contrast, the presence of Collembola caused a reduction in plant biomass particularly that of P. annua roots, but plant tissue nitrogen concentration was increased, although only slightly. Aphid reproduction on T. repens was lowered in the presence of Collembola on average by 45% but on P. annua increased by a factor of about 3. It is concluded that Collembola decrease aphid reproduction on more palatable host plants like T. repens but increase that on less palatable ones like P. annua. Earthworm presence also affected aphid reproduction but the effect was less consistent than that of Collembola. In the presence of earthworms, aphid reproduction was in one experimental period increased by some 70%. Earthworms also modified the numbers of Collembola and their vertical distribution in experimental chambers. Exploitation of deeper soil layers by H. nitidus was increased but, generally, O. scotarius numbers were reduced whereas those of H. nitidus increased in earthworm treatments. The presence of Collembola also influenced earthworm body mass during the experiment. In general it declined, but in the presence of Collembola loss of body mass of A. caliginosa was more pronounced. We conclude that inhibiting effects between Collembola and earthworms resulted from the use of a common resource, litter material rich in nitrogen. This is supported by the higher C/N ratio of the litter material in the presence of earthworms and Collembola by the end of the experiment. Effects of soil invertebrates like Collembola and earthworms on plant performance and aphid development are assumed to be modified by complex direct and indirect interactions among soil animal groups.","Jun 1999","DOI: 10.1007/s004420050817","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225741988_Links_between_the_detritivore_and_the_herbivore_system_Effects_of_earthworms_and_Collembola_on_plant_growth_and_aphid_development?_sg=u7RkKeGm7zxcjYbsBU-gVS8fy0PS4M3S0bu2HMeONIg0QBN5j8r5wRIl3217eT4T3CUHZqWO5vQFIe4"

Many studies now show that plant genetics can drive changes in the structure of both above and belowground communities; however, the role of plant genetic variation in mediating aboveground-belowground interactions is still unclear. We used an earthworm-plant-aphid model system with two aphid species (Aphis fabae and Acyrthosiphon pisum) to test the effect of host-plant (Vicia faba) genetic variation on the indirect interaction between the belowground earthworms (Eisenia veneta) on the aboveground aphid populations. Results Our data shows that host-plant variety mediated an indirect ecological effect of earthworms on generalist black bean aphids (A. fabae), with earthworms increasing aphid growth rate in three plant varieties but decreasing it in another variety. We found no effect of earthworms on the second aphid species, the pea aphid (A. pisum), and no effect of competition between the aphid species. Plant biomass was increased when earthworms were present, and decreased when A. pisum was feeding on the plant (mediated by plant variety). Although A. fabae aphids were influenced by the plants and worms, they did not, in turn, alter plant biomass. Conclusions Previous work has shown inconsistent effects of earthworms on aphids, but we suggest these differences could be explained by plant genetic variation and variation among aphid species. This study demonstrates that the outcome of belowground-aboveground interactions can be mediated by genetic variation in the host-plant, but depends on the identity of the species involved.","Dec 2014","DOI: 10.1186/s12898-014-0025-5","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267922744_Plant_genetic_variation_mediates_an_indirect_ecological_effect_between_belowground_earthworms_and_aboveground_aphids?_sg=TFRsRfABdbPP5U1vtgQNPjmNSM95DzdWxZ4ThweZIOFKwqkZBheNmXE8cGbD1AUocyx-ke1nObVUB3M"

Zaller","Invasion of non-native species is among the top threats for the biodiversity and functioning of native and agricultural ecosystems worldwide. We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms—Annelida: Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi—AMF, Glomerales). We hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites, AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 % (P < 0.001). Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community structure.","Jun 2013","DOI: 10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257407432_Herbivory_of_an_invasive_slug_in_a_model_grassland_community_can_be_affected_by_earthworms_and_mycorrhizal_fungi?_sg=Y7l2D9VuUg0XgTFz_dZkbEBcFBwqoxEpgvwU1HSM2c9HM4WPmT0mKBqPYtChY4XySE80BpNc0pH8ddE"

Van Der Putten","Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non-leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, but Lotus corniculatus flowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant-feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities.","Mar 2008","DOI: 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16333.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227793950_Earthworms_counterbalance_the_negative_effect_of_microorganisms_on_plant_diversity_and_enhance_the_tolerance_of_grasses_to_nematodes?_sg=a2pMybNoiz86CYvsviGvvtbKF0PpfWuzTVVtHfwcqyUhpLc0G1LpYlOWvlhl3wLhb3cQPTGq6J0zqic"

The aphids preferred to colonize plants without earthworms in the soil, and the numbers of aphids remained lower on the plants with earthworms, irrespective of the presence of AMF. Although the N, C, and P concentrations of the shoots were not affected by the soil organisms, AMF increased total aboveground biomass, total N, C, and P content, and photosynthetic activity (measured as electron transport rate) in the leaves under high light intensity.

Moreover, these two processes are interlinked as ecosystem invasibility is considered to increase with decreasing biodiversity. In temperate grasslands, earthworms serve as important ecosystem engineers making up the majority of soil faunal biomass. Herbivore behaviour has been shown to be affected by earthworms, however it is unclear whether these effects differ with the composition of plant communities. To test this we conducted a mesocosm experiment where we added earthworms (Annelida: Lumbricidae) to planted grassland communities with different plant species composition (3 vs. 12 plant spp.). Plant communities had equal plant densities and ratios of the functional groups grasses, non-leguminous forbs and legumes. Later, Arion vulgaris slugs (formerly known as A. lusitanicus; Gastropoda: Arionidae) were added and allowed to freely choose among the available plant species. This slug species is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe. We hypothesized that (i) the food choice of slugs would be altered by earthworms’ specific effects on the growth and nutrient content of plant species, (ii) slug herbivory will be less affected by earthworms in plant communities containing more plant species than in those with fewer plant species because of a more readily utilization of plant resources making the impacts of earthworms less pronounced. Results Slug herbivory was significantly affected by both earthworms and plant species composition. Slugs damaged 60% less leaves when earthworms were present, regardless of the species composition of the plant communities. Percent leaf area consumed by slugs was 40% lower in communities containing 12 plant species; in communities containing only three species earthworms increased slug leaf area consumption. Grasses were generally avoided by slugs. Leaf length and number of tillers was increased in mesocosms containing more plant species but little influenced by earthworms. Overall shoot biomass was decreased, root biomass increased in plant communities with more plant species. Earthworms decreased total shoot biomass in mesocosms with more plant species but did not affect biomass production of individual functional groups. Plant nitrogen concentrations across three focus species were 18% higher when earthworms were present; composition of plant communities did not affect plant quality.

For example, significant delays can occur between the human activities permitting the arrival of an invader, the establishment of this new species, and the manifestation of its impacts. In this context, to assess the influence of anthropogenic disturbances, it may become necessary to include a historical perspective. In this study, we reconstructed the history of human activities in a temperate forest now protected as a nature reserve to evaluate the magnitude and duration of the impact of human disturbances (e.g. trails, old quarries), as well as environmental factors, in explaining the probability of occurrence and the intensity of invasion by non-native earthworms and plants. The present-day patterns of distribution and intensity of earthworms and plants were better explained by proximity to the oldest human disturbances (initiated more than a century ago) than by proximity to more recent disturbances or to all disturbances combined. We conclude that understanding present-day patterns of non-native species invasions may often require reconstructing the history of human disturbances that occurred decades or even centuries in the past.","Apr 2014","DOI: 10.1007/s10530-014-0794-y","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273894703_Historical_anthropogenic_disturbances_influence_patterns_of_non-native_earthworm_and_plant_invasions_in_a_temperate_primary_forest?_sg=ZabnVTQT8jBCvPqaBfRC0W2hvskl3SxC8R9MSdk3yQrppC8wtbEx3vvYlBPN5vJK3GhAPKEJqVsluqU"

Little is known about the landscape scale responses of earthworm populations to different regional characteristics and vegetation types within Canada’s central woodlands. We examined the spatial variation of earthworm species richness, biomass, and assemblage composition across a range of four municipal regions (from south to north: Halton, Wellington, York, and Simcoe) and four habitat types (deciduous forest, mixed forest, tree plantation, and meadow) with varying soil characteristics in woodlands of south-central Ontario, Canada. In general, earthworm communities differed by region but not by habitat type. The most southern regions supported the highest earthworm species richness, biomass (i.e. Lumbricus and Octolasion), and density, and this was associated with a south-north gradient in soil characteristics. Assemblage composition differed by region but not by habitat type. Our results provide baseline information about earthworm communities in south-central Ontario forests, and will enable managers to plan for the increasing role of earthworms in Canada’s future forests.","Jan 2017","DOI: 10.1139/cjfr-2016-0337","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312564710_Exotic_earthworm_Oligochaeta_Lumbricidae_assemblages_on_a_landscape-scale_in_central_Canadian_woodlands_Importance_of_region_and_vegetation_type?_sg=fCH9OlICqO7sV4PPS6o1YM1omXAfXt2hKBp8psRcJSq5bOsrc0GSp88cJ884FL7rJfVL79kT5CJvGjA"
64,"MA3","Exotic earthworms of great lakes forests: A search for indicator plant species in maple forests","Kathryn Corio","Gary Fewless","The invasion of exotic earthworms in previously earthworm-free northern deciduous forests has been linked to the disappearance of forest floor litter, declines in plant species richness, and the development of monotypic stands of Carex pensylvanica. However, the impact of exotic earthworms on the regeneration of trees and understory plants is largely unknown. We examined the relationships between earthworm density, plant species richness, leaf litter accumulation, number of tree (Acer) seedlings, and cover of C. pensylvanica at 14 sites in mesic hardwood forests of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Earthworm biomass, especially of the genera Lumbricus, Aporrectodea, and Octolasion was negatively associated with leaf litter mass and number of Acer seedlings. Nine plant species, including two spring ephemerals (Dicentra cucullaria and Osmorhiza claytonii), a sedge (Carexdeweyana), and an invasive mint (Galeopsis tetrahit) were negatively correlated with exotic earthworm densities. Dryopteris intermedia and Allium tricoccum, on the other hand, were associated with high earthworm densities. The activities of exotic earthworms appear to have significant impacts on Acer regeneration and the persistence of many herbaceous plants. Our findings suggest that the effects of exotic earthworms on litter mass are strongly related to the observed effects on species composition. Sensitive species can be used as indicators of high and low earthworm densities and might be useful for identifying forests of high conservation value where future invasions of exotic earthworms should be prevented.","Sep 2009","DOI: 10.1016/j.foreco.2009.05.013","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248428011_Exotic_earthworms_of_Great_Lakes_forests_a_search_for_indicator_plant_species_in_maple_forests?_sg=S4bm9or5oqJc3xmEpionF6dnJFdkppBZdYcsrSL-h54iMRpNaBHsxJeQoA-0Aiu3vKWMowfKvnsLNYY"

The current extent of invasion by some of these species, Lumbricus terrestris L., Octolasion tyrtaeum Savigny and Dendrobaena octaedra Savigny, into an aspen forest in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and the effects of the invasion on soil chemistry, microflora, soil microarthropods and vegetation were investigated. Densities of earthworm species, soil structure, plant coverage and abundance were determined along three transects starting at the edge of the forest. At locations with L. terrestris, litter was incorporated into the soil, and where O. tyrtaeum was present, organic layers were mixed with mineral soil layers. Organic layers disappeared almost entirely when both species occurred together. Carbon and nitrogen concentrations were reduced in organic layers in the presence of L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum. Microbial biomass and basal respiration were reduced when L. terrestris and O. tyrtaeum were present, presumably due to resource competition and habitat destruction. Microarthropod densities and the number of microarthropod species were strongly reduced in the presence of O. tyrtaeum (−75% and −22%, respectively), probably through mechanical disturbances, increasing compactness of the soil and resource competition. The coverage of some plant species was correlated with earthworm abundance, but the coverage of others was not. Despite harsh climatic conditions, the invasion of boreal forest ecosystems by mineral soil dwelling earthworm species is proceeding and strongly impacts soil structure, soil chemistry, microorganisms, soil microarthropods and vegetation.","May 2007","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.12.019","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222207820_Invasion_of_a_deciduous_forest_by_earthworms_Changes_in_soil_chemistry_microflora_microarthropods_and_vegetation?_sg=K1aqutGHNXXeq_KeIfVZ-xP3f_cVbSpPReV-HuTBSuabsP2nirC8Dbb7ncPYWd_5_g4TwBjtJLuT4MI"

We sampled earthworm densities and understory plant species cover in transects located in paired old- and second-growth forests in Indiana. Two 100-m transects were established within each forest stand during late April to early May in each year. One transect was placed parallel to and within 5 m of a south- or west-facing edge. The second transect was placed parallel to the first. but at no less than 100 m from any edge. Nonnative earthworms and plants were found in forest edge and interior regardless of structural stage (second-growth vs. old-growth). The number of native plant species decreased linearly as the densities of adult Lumbricus and Aporrectodea earthworms and the percent cover of multiflora rose (an invasive plant species) increased. Densities of L. terrestris and Aporrectodea earthworms and percent cover of multiflora rose cumulatively explained 39% of the variation in the number of native plant species found in transects across the state. However, multivariate analyses suggested that the species composition of Indiana understory plant communities was affected more by geography than by earthworm densities. Our results suggest that nonnative earthworms and plants are ubiquitous in Indiana hardwood forests and that they may reduce the number of native plant species.","Mar 2013","DOI: 10.1614/IPSM-D-12-00046.1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273944536_Invasive_Earthworms_and_Plants_in_Indiana_Old-_and_Second-Growth_Forests?_sg=RTBOlUd4XMx9oVtsdFQEwI8J2W9jjdQf6hRUUTTgHV5PDtIybmlLsYwvk-XUZ2ZVBWJAiBgL1FLGPAY"

Reich","European earthworms are colonizing earthworm-free northern hardwood forests across North America. Leading edges of earthworm invasion provide an opportunity to investigate the response of understory plant communities to earthworm invasion and whether the species composition of the earthworm community influences that response. Four sugar maple-dominated forest sites with active earthworm invasions were identified in the Chippewa National Forest in north central Minnesota, USA. In each site, we established a 30 x 150 m sample grid that spanned a visible leading edge of earthworm invasion and sampled earthworm populations and understory vegetation over four years. Across leading edges of earthworm invasion, increasing total earthworm biomass was associated with decreasing diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants in two of four study sites, and the abundance and density of tree seedlings decreased in three of four study sites. Sample points with the most diverse earthworm species assemblage, independent of biomass, had the lowest plant diversity. Changes in understory plant community composition were most affected by increasing biomass of the earthworm species Lumbricus rubellus. Where L. rubellus was absent there was a diverse community of native herbaceous plants, but where L. rubellus biomass reached its maximum, the herbaceous-plant community was dominated by Carex pensylvanica and Arisaema triphyllum and, in some cases, was completely absent. Evidence from these forest sites suggests that earthworm invasion can lead to dramatic changes in the understory community and that the nature of these changes is influenced by the species composition of the invading earthworm community.","Aug 2006","DOI: 10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1637:CIHFUP]2.0.CO;2","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6866478_Changes_in_hardwood_forest_understory_plant_communities_in_response_to_European_earthworm_invasions?_sg=MMK9Cpt4d_gHBjlt2bp0rphWq6IOCMmNfvsLh3_Xkge7-7ma1gkrFAQBNGS3pOeen8KsKXlNfnvTeB4"

Hopfensperger","Sarah Hamilton","In previously-glaciated eastern deciduous forests the effects of non-native earthworms on ecosystem dynamics including nutrient cycling, forest floor depth, and plant species diversity are often documented. Less well examined are non-native earthworm communities in unglaciated portions of eastern deciduous forests. We have been surveying earthworm and plant communities in Southwest Virginia since 2007 in 16 sites ranging from small woodlots to large nature reserves. Results/Conclusions Although historically native earthworms have been reported in the region, we have found no native earthworms from about 2,000 individuals collected. We have found 14 species of European origins and one of Asian origins. To date, we have found no correlations between earthworm abundance or diversity and plant community metrics or topographical features. Nonetheless, commonalities among earthworm communities include 1) Lumbricus terrestris (aneic niche) or L. rubellus (epigeic niche) or both are present at every site and are often the most abundant species; 2) at most sites, either Octolasion spp. or Apporectodea spp. are the second most common Genera (all are in the endogeic niche) and these Genera are rarely in the same site; and 3) mean species richnesses (for adults 2.53 (0.67 SE) and for juveniles 2.10 (0.27 SE)) are relatively low compared to a regional species pool of 15 species. Taken together our results indicate that earthworm communities in unglaciated eastern deciduous forests can be exclusively non-native and have low functional redundancy (e.g., richness about equals functional diversity). Understanding the implications of non-native earthworm communities is important as these ecosystem engineers are a driver of ecosystem dynamics.","Aug 2014","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267288043_Non-native_earthworm_community_dynamics_in_unglaciated_eastern_deciduous_forests_Patterns_of_functional_and_species_diversity?_sg=g0tJPFPlQSicOhIKN-6P4GW62BpGMyJOdMb7gQ5c9PWI4yAnIW3uIpPK_iDUMO0t8Wt6ZtB_aVjy6So"

Towards this effort, we examined both the above and belowground plant communities, along with soil organic matter, pH, texture and light in Arnot Forest located in south central New York. Two transects were aligned parallel to previously defined gradients of earthworm density and were sampled in the spring and summer of 2008. We found plots codominated by multiple earthworm species decreased belowground seed abundance and species richness. Aboveground plant cover and diversity along with soil organic matter was lower along the transect with multiple earthworm species. In addition, we found earthworm density increased with soil pH, but did not detect relationships with soil texture or light intensity. Our results were consistent with previous findings of earthworms negatively affecting aboveground plant communities and soil organic matter, and increasing pH. Our study demonstrates the potential for exotic earthworms to dramatically alter forest soil seed banks; however, future research is needed to investigate complexities of earthworm community dynamics (e.g., number and life form of earthworm species) and to tease apart mechanisms responsible for changes in the belowground plant community.","Jul 2011","DOI: 10.1674/0003-0031-166.1.53","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232693324_Influence_of_Invasive_Earthworms_on_Above_and_Belowground_Vegetation_in_a_Northern_Hardwood_Forest?_sg=AVgXQBnyIMrWDEio36E8516arze6aGQsIx8aHbOxmlycsLIomcoo3h8GsejuwR2kEoCZfzUkgHwyHbI"

Quantification of invasions is necessary for understanding impacts and identifying remnant earthworm-free areas, but existing sampling techniques are effort-intensive and/or environmentally damaging. We: (1) developed and applied a protocol that allows rapid classification of earthworm invasion into five stages based primarily on visual assessment of the forest floor, (2) sampled earthworms to test whether the protocol's stages can predict invasion by different species, and (3) assessed relationships between individual forest floor characteristics and presence of different earthworm species. Based on differences in biomass among points assigned to different stages, the 5-stage classification protocol accurately identified the onset of invasion by Lumbricus rubellus and Lumbricus terrestris, the species of greatest management concern in the northern Midwest. Except for middens as a predictor of L. terrestris presence, no forest floor variable was useful by itself for assessing invasions. The 5-stage protocol provides an efficient approach for assessing earthworm invasions in hardwood forests of the U.S. northern Midwest, can be implemented with minimal training, and serves as a blueprint for similar protocols in other regions experiencing earthworm invasions.","Jan 2013","DOI: 10.3375/043.033.0103","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236672986_Earthworm_Invasions_in_Northern_Hardwood_Forests_a_Rapid_Assessment_Method?_sg=Zs9lTUTzfJ5UwXj-h-AgIZicFGJ92IAMTg28aYVpjWDvH4T-ZfFHhdF-58gklvRHlWShU_EfLb7RXfs"

NUZZO","BERND BLOSSEY","Identification of factors that drive changes in plant community structure and contribute to decline and endangerment of native plant species is essential to the development of appropriate management strategies. Introduced species are assumed to be driving causes of shifts in native plant communities, but unequivocal evidence supporting this view is frequently lacking. We measured native vegetation, non-native earthworm biomass, and leaf-litter volume in 15 forests in the presence and absence of 3 non-native plant species (Microstegium vimineum, Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii) to assess the general impact of non-native plant and earthworm invasions on native plant communities in northeastern United States. Non-native plant cover was positively correlated with total native plant cover and non-native earthworm biomass. Earthworm biomass was negatively associated with cover of native woody and most herbaceous plants and with litter volume. Graminoid cover was positively associated with non-native earthworm biomass and non-native plant cover. These earthworm-associated responses were detected at all sites despite differences in earthworm species and abundance, composition of the native plant community, identity of invasive plant species, and geographic region. These patterns suggest earthworm invasion, rather than non-native plant invasion, is the driving force behind changes in forest plant communities in northeastern North America, including declines in native plant species, and earthworm invasions appear to facilitate plant invasions in these forests. Thus, a focus on management of invasive plant species may be insufficient to protect northeastern forest understory species.","Mar 2009","DOI: 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01168.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24034178_Earthworm_Invasion_as_the_Driving_Force_Behind_Plant_Invasion_and_Community_Change_in_Northeastern_North_American_Forests?_sg=LtfALvEQzfBXOp5VybuPqHHYjLlt2PKRjtv25-2JQNlnh8ChtwUViAOxbxDwLfuYn1Ws3D-tUthaj3A"

As a result of browsing, direct influences include significant changes in the composition of the understory seedling and sapling composition, abundance and diversity. Although direct effects of white-tailed deer browsing are well studied indirect effects of herbivory are not well understood. From 1979-1990, deer density was manipulated in regions of Allegheny hardwood forests in NW Pennsylvania and ultimately resulted in significant changes in understory composition. Roughly thirty years after the initial research indirect effects of deer browsing are being studied, in particular insect composition, abundance and diversity. We hypothesized that tree species most impacted by deer would have the greatest insect density because these species are likely to be poorly defended by plant chemicals. In 2009, we sampled insects from 261 branch tips of the most common tree species using a pole-mounted tree pruner and collection bag. Bags were sealed and brought to the lab, where all arthropods were collected, counted, identified, photographed using a calibrated digital camera and preserved for identification. Leaves from each branch were removed, dried and weighed and caterpillar abundance was standardized to number per kg leaf mass. Differences in caterpillar density among tree species were analyzed with general linear mixed models in SAS 9.1. Results/Conclusions Dominant tree species were red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), sweet birch (Betula lenta), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica), and black cherry (Prunus serotina). Tree species significantly (P = 0.0056) differed in mean caterpillar density per kg foliage. Pin cherry supported over five times the number of caterpillars as black cherry, the species with the next-highest caterpillar density. Caterpillar density on black cherry did not significantly differ from density on other tree species. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that plants most impacted by deer would have the highest caterpillar density. Data collected in summer 2010 will determine if insect communities that occur on different tree species differ in composition and if the relative proportions of host generalists and specialists differ on each tree species. Results of this study will enable a better understanding of the indirect effects deer have on insect populations in forest ecosystems that were previously exposed to white-tailed deer over-browsing.","Aug 2010","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267282543_Effects_of_white-tailed_deer_browsing_on_insect_diversity_in_Allegheny_hardwood_forests?_sg=4S-gGYPrcaA2b1X9sA2gBrbZSCjDmfWmuWWuT2kOKPbg-aw097FujJtEFiGFhgiR8frkmshlzsJB2Cc"

The impacts of these fires on the belowground ecosystem have yet to be measured. Soil (0 to 10 cm) and litter samples were collected 12, 19, and 24 months following the most recent fire on 40 plots in burned and un-burned control areas. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured and compared with vegetation composition and structure from these same plots. Compared to un-burned controls, burn plots had greater canopy openness, greater herbaceous richness, and a lower spring/summer herbaceous ratio. Burned plots had higher soil moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca2 +, Mg2 +, K+, Na+, NO3−, total N, particulate organic matter (POM), total organic C, and potential N mineralization. Soil microbial biomass and respiration, texture, color, aggregate stability, and hydrophobicity were not different in burned compared to un-burned plots. Indices of litter and soil invertebrate diversity were also not affected by prescribed fire. Three stepwise least squares models predicted woody richness, herbaceous richness, and spring/summer herbs with aspect, litter invertebrate richness, and soil factors (pH, potential N mineralization, C/N ratio, Mg2 +, Bray P, and soil invertebrate Simpson index). These results confirm others showing prescribed fire to increase soil nutrient availability. Forest structural changes with fire appear correlated with soil nutrient availability. Decreased soil C, nutrient retention, invertebrate diversity, or increased hydrophobicity and the presence of exotic plants is often observed with high-severity fire; but, these negative impacts do not appear to be present with these long-term, low-severity fires.","Aug 2012","DOI: 10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.03.010","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256716431_Two_decades_of_low-severity_prescribed_fire_increases_soil_nutrient_availability_in_a_Midwestern_USA_oak_Quercus_forest?_sg=M4EJZXF72y8yojCWIjlUFvFEbloLfLHO0N0_cwOHvQW9FH-PceOuYSVzj37VqNicgiJs5d49xqb4ggo"

Particularly exotic ecosystem engineers such as earthworms potentially have profound impacts on community assembly and functioning. We investigated the impact of invasion by the lumbricid earthworms into an aspen forest of the Canadian Rocky Mountains on soil organic matter, microorganisms and microarthropod communities. Building on the results of previous studies in this forest, we expected positive effects of Lumbricus terrestris middens and negative effects of Octolasion tyrtaeum on soil biota (increase and decrease in soil nutrient concentrations, microbial parameters and soil microarthropod density and diversity, respectively). Further, we expected that earthworm effects change with time. Combined results of previous and the present study suggest a wavelike colonization pattern for Dendrobaena octaedra and O. tyrtaeum and that indeed the impact of earthworms on soil biota changed with time, likely due to changes in earthworm density. Unexpectedly, L. terrestris middens neither affected soil abiotic nor soil biotic properties. By contrast and in contrast to our hypothesis, carbon and nitrogen concentration and C‐to‐N ratio in deeper soil layers increased in presence of O. tyrtaeum , thereby likely enhancing nutrient availability for soil microorganisms and microarthropods. Even though the density of this endogeic species was rather low, presence of O. tyrtaeum resulted in increased densities of a number of microarthropod taxa and increased microarthropod diversity. The results suggest that at low density, invasive ecosystem engineers, such as O. tyrtaeum, cause disturbances of intermediate strength thereby beneficially affecting soil microorganisms and most microarthropods. This contrasts earlier effects during the wavelike invasion of O. tyrtaeum into the aspen forest when densities of O. tyrtaeum were high resulting in generally detrimental effects on soil biota. The results emphasize the nonlinearity of earthworm effects on abiotic and biotic soil properties and call for further long‐term investigations.","Jun 2009","DOI: 10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17405.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202001036_Nonlinearity_of_effects_of_invasive_ecosystem_engineers_on_abiotic_soil_properties_and_soil_biota?_sg=AvCwbpB0TMs1lecQrsJ5rj9z7sFVqzCfnf5DQN1yodHmKBYJyHsIOGFT8-665vr2QYLS81ZwiZ0m-qs"

Litsinger","The oligochaete Dichogaster nr. curgensis Michaelsen, has become a pest of irrigated rice in the Philippine terraced highlands. Heavy erosion of the deforested Abra River watershed deposited unnaturally high numbers (13,659 m−2) of this epigeic earthworm along the riverbank, which subsequently became concentrated in irrigated rice fields (17,294 m−2) in over 20,000 ha. The earthworms' burrowing activity caused leaks in rice levees and body setae mechanically injured roots resulting in plant stunting and seedling death. Infested fields exhibited reduced plant stand and uneven growth. Rice was more sensitive to damage occurring during the vegetative than reproductive stage. The crop could tolerate earthworm densities of 140 m−2 but suffered significant yield loss when populations were ten times higher, and complete loss at 700 m−2. Field observations and greenhouse tests showed prolonged flooding reduces earthworm densities. Seedbeds should be located away from the rice fields and taller seedlings (45–55 days old) should be transplanted to tolerate >14 cm depth ponding until the late reproductive stage. A preventative method of creating holding ponds is suggested to trap earthworms before irrigation water passes to the fields.

Wider surveys in eastern Australia recorded 75 native or exotic earthworm species and 27 of these were screened in a series of glasshouse trials to find candidates for field introduction. Whereas some earthworm populations declined in glasshouse soil cores, a maximum increase in numbers in six months was 10-fold. Increases in yield of oats or grass test crops associated with earthworm activity were as high as 60 or 80%, while yield of grain sorghum doubled. Not all species were equally effective: a few were found to depress plant yield. However, 12 species were selected for field trials.

Kumar","Soil is the habitat of plant roots and of a diverse array of organisms - bacteria, fungi, protozoa and invertebrate animals - which contribute to the maintenance and productivity of agroecosystems. As intensification occurs, the regulation of functions through soil biodiversity is progressively replaced by regulation through chemical and mechanical inputs. However, the causal relationships between composition, diversity and abundance of soil organisms and sustained soil fertility are unclear. Furthermore, in tropical agricultural systems undergoing intensification, large numbers of farmers have limited access to inputs, and therefore the maintenance and enhancement of soil biodiversity may be particularly relevant to such farmers. In this paper we propose a number of hypotheses which could be tested to explore the relationships between agricultural intensification, biodiversity in tropical soils and ecosystem functions. We also provide a conceptual framework within which such hypotheses can be tested.","Aug 1997","DOI: 10.1016/S0929-1393(96)00154-0","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271132375_Agricultural_intensification_soil_biodiversity_and_agroecosystem_function_in_the_tropics_The_role_of_earthworms?_sg=38J_uKxysGJJuZ8CeWIme6yH8CxjiSYU-m6u3fwtJPWIkIuotrngER81qMMMHvS2BYP7T44S_OP9ke8"

Interactions of plant functional groups and species within the soil decomposer community resulted in significant shifts of plant competitive strength and therefore are likely to affect the rate of the successional development of plant communities.Depending on the functional role of the decomposer taxa involved, either legumes, or non-leguminous forbs were more negatively affected. Therefore, increasing species numbers with in the decomposer community gradually reduced the relative contribution of forbs (legumes and non-leguminous forbs), although fundamentally different mechanisms were responsible for these effects. Surprisingly, not the biomass-dominant annelid taxa, but collembola had the strongest effects on plant performance. The grass-to-forb ratio, an indicator of successional change, shifted from 3 to 4 in presence of collembola, suggesting that indirect effects on microbial symbionts of plants were more important than classic decomposer effects via increased and more constant nutrient availability to plants. Total plant productivity, however, was not affected, since grasses gained competitive advantage and compensated with increased growth for the negative animal effects on forb performance. Our results highlight the importance of specific functional groups among decomposers for structuring grassland plant communities. However, great plasticity in the plant community through negative covariance between forbs and grasses, partly compensated for decomposer effects at the plant canopy level.","Mar 2012","DOI: 10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.11.013","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256854222_Decomposer_community_complexity_affects_plant_competition_in_a_model_early_successional_grassland_community?_sg=Peaw9XBBJDH1yaZC2hiKeeXHXST_mi9x4Qki160NSnF68Y1SyQlSKr4DoMvBrEgGwYd5wdVlCjZ2Bos"

Soil fertility is no longer restored and crop yields have decreased drastically. The leguminous plant, Lotus uliginosus (trefoil), used as a cover crop, has made possible the control of erosion, the restoration of soil macrofauna, especially earthworms, and the increase in crop yields. When trefoil was associated with earthworms (Amynthas corticis), the densities of maize, the yields of maize stalk and dry matter, the yield of trefoil fodder dry matter, and the biomass and respiratory activity of soil microflora were considerably increased. The combined effects of their association led to a significant decrease in populations of the plant-parasitic nematode, Pratylenchus vulnus, in maize roots, and in the population of borers.

When fertilizers were withheld from some buckets after 7 months grass growth during the remainder of the study was significantly greater in the presence of earthworms under both organic (+222%) and inorganic (+114%) regimes. It is considered that grass growth responses were mainly due to enhanced organic matter decomposition and mineralization.

We manipulated earthworms in PVC-encased soil cores (20 cm diameter) over a 45-day period under field conditions. Treatments included: (1) control with no earthworms, (2) Diplocardia spp. only, and (3) O. tyrtaeum only. Prior to addition of earthworms, seedlings of Andropogon gerardii (a dominant tallgrass) were established in each core, and a dilute solution of 13C-labeled glucose and 15N-labeled (NH4)2SO4 was added to the soil to facilitate examination of earthworm/microbe/plant interactions. We found that Diplocardia spp. were significantly more active than O. tyrtaeum, and quickly assimilated 13C and 15N from the tracer. Individuals of Diplocardia spp. were present at shallower soil depths than O. tyrtaeum throughout the study. Contrary to expectation, this greater activity of Diplocardia spp. did not result in increased plant productivity. Rather, the activity of Diplocardia spp. was associated with less plant growth and smaller amounts of N acquired by A. gerardii seedlings compared to controls or O. tyrtaeum treatments. We observed few significant influences of earthworm treatments on microbial biomass C or N pool sizes, but the microbial C/N ratio was consistently greater in the presence of Diplocardia spp. relative to O. tyrtaeum.

The controlled-environment experiments used split-pots in all possible combinations of with or without earthworms and with or without Ggt on either side of a semi-permeable membrane. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to study gross changes in the microbial community associated with these treatments. The results from the field experiments showed that earthworms increased the yield, but had no effect on the severity of Ggt in soft white spring wheat. Similarly, in the controlled-environment experiments Aporrectodea tuberculata increased plant growth, but had no effect on the severity of Ggt. There was a significant increase in the percent total N and a lower C:N ratio regardless of earthworms in Ggt infested soil compared with non-infested soil. The PLFA analysis showed that earthworms increased the total amount of PLFA in soil and the activity of Gram negative bacteria. This indicated that there was a larger and more active microbial population when earthworms were present. The PLFA ratio of bacteria: fungi showed a significant interaction between earthworms and take-all. Earthworms increased the fungal biomass in the Ggt inoculated treatment and in contrast, promoted the bacteria when there was no Ggt.

Unplanted soils (UPS) were used as controls. In planted soils without earthworm (PS) total plant biomass decreased with each cropping by up to 50%. However, in planted soils with earthworms (PES) the total plant biomass loss was only 17%. This pattern was explained by the earthworm effect. Compared to the unplanted soils, the planted soils had an increased (mean +37%) mineralisation of 15N adsorbed onto fine clays and a partial transfer of 15N to silt and coarse clay. The quantities of 15N mineralised and transferred were higher in the planted soils with earthworms, indicating an amplification of the phenomenon in the presence of earthworms. The simultaneous effect of the rhizosphere and the drilosphere did not lead to increased mineralisation of N adsorbed onto coarse clays and silts but instead a greater transfer of N associated with the fine fractions towards the coarser fractions.","Jan 2001","DOI: 10.1007/s003740000311","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226447392_Simultaneous_effects_of_plants_and_earthworms_on_mineralisation_of_15N-labelled_organic_compounds_adsorbed_onto_soil_size_fractions?_sg=2zq-lLc1k1qVViuubtjBUZy_hOVxJGKJ4xNz_KkUSzSDnYIAPE9oz6-oWRlAVRLtwEQqMPxYHVmZ_JU"

Three experiments are reported. In experiment 1, A. trapezoides (1, 3 or 6 per pot of 1 kg soil) in the sandy loan was associated with a significant increase in the growth (31%) of wheat seedlings at 7 weeks old, but had no significant effect in the loam or clay soils. The presence of earthworms was associated with increased foliar N concentrations (10–20%) and water-use efficiency (4–17%) in all three soil types. In experiment 2, there were no significant effects of A. trapezoides or A. rosea (10 per pot of 4 kg soil) on the dry weight of faba beans at 10 weeks old, except for A. rosea in the loam soil which reduced the total dry weight by 17%. In experiment 3, both A. trapezoides and a. rosea (10 per pot of 4 kg soil) caused a significant increase in the dry weight of barley plants (60%), root growth (40% and 30%, respectively) the number of tillers (50% and 35%, respectively) and grain yields (50% and 45%, respectively) in the sandy loam soil but had no effect on these measures in the loam soil. In the clay soil the presence of both earthworm species was associated with a substantially reduced plant dry weight (40% and 20%, respectively), tiller number (20%) and grain yield (40% and 20%, respectively). A further treatment (NPK fertiliser applied at a rate commonly used in the field) produced no increase in growth of faba beans or wheat.

90,"MA4","Earthworms as drivers of the competition between grasses and legumes","Valerie Eviner","Valerie Eviner","Grasses and legumes are grown together worldwide to improve total herbage yield and the quality of forage, however, the causes of population oscillations of grasses and legumes are poorly understood. Especially in grasslands, earthworms are among the most important detritivore animals functioning as ecosystem engineers, playing a key role in nutrient cycling and affecting plant nutrition and growth. The objectives of the present greenhouse experiment were to quantify the effects of earthworms on grass-legume competition in model grassland systems at two harvesting dates - simulating the widespread biannual mowing regime in Central European grasslands. The presence of earthworms increased the productivity of grasses and legumes after 6 weeks but only that of grasses after another 10 weeks. In mixed treatments, the presence of grasses and earthworms decreased legume shoot biomass, the amount of nitrogen (N) in shoot tissue and the number of legume flowerheads while the presence of legumes and earthworms increased the amount of N in grass shoots and the infestation of grasses with aphids. Analyses of N-15/N-14 ratios indicate that. compared to legumes, grasses more efficiently exploit soil mineral N and benefit from legume presence through reduced ""intra-functional group"" competition. In contrast to previous experiments, we found no evidence for N transfer from legumes to grasses. However, legume presence improved total herbage and N yield. Earthworms likely modulate the competition between grasses and legumes by increasing soil N uptake by plants and thereby increasing the competitive strength of grasses. Earthworms function as essential driving agents of grass-legume associations by (I) increasing grass yield, (II) increasing the amount of N in grass hay, (III) increasing the infestation rate of grasses with aphids, and (IV) potentially reducing the attractiveness of grass-legume associations to pollinators.

The mechanisms that make communities resistant to invasions and drive the establishment success of seedlings are essential both for management and for understanding community assembly and structure. Especially in grasslands, anecic earthworms are known to function as ecosystem engineers, however, their direct effects on plant community composition and on the invasibility of plant communities via plant seed burial, ingestion and digestion are poorly understood. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the impact of Lumbricus terrestris , plant functional group identity and seed size of plant invader species and plant functional group of the established plant community on the number and biomass of plant invaders. We set up 120 microcosms comprising four plant community treatments, two earthworm treatments and three plant invader treatments containing three seed size classes. Earthworm performance was influenced by an interaction between plant functional group identity of the established plant community and that of invader species. The established plant community and invader seed size affected the number of invader plants significantly, while invader biomass was only affected by the established community. Since earthworm effects on the number and biomass of invader plants varied with seed size and plant functional group identity they probably play a key role in seedling establishment and plant community composition. Seeds and germinating seedlings in earthworm burrows may significantly contribute to earthworm nutrition, but this deserves further attention. Lumbricus terrestris likely behaves like a ‘farmer’ by collecting plant seeds which cannot directly be swallowed or digested. Presumably, these seeds are left in middens and become eatable after partial microbial decay. Increased earthworm numbers in more diverse plant communities likely contribute to the positive relationship between plant species diversity and resistance against invaders.","May 2008","DOI: 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16812.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230255675_Invasibility_of_experimental_grassland_communities_The_role_of_earthworms_plant_functional_group_identity_and_seed_size?_sg=t-W4uDZEkLyL7M24-1PgHTujdqidxBIiziQntN_NAQ__gy2vkoM39o5qHJjU-_16X5-EJ_wmNEU4DGw"

Reducing earthworm populations for up to 12-weeks did not affect grass yield or N uptake.

To address this need, our research examined the role of earthworms and litter management on nutrient dynamics, soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization, and crop growth in the Quesungual agroforestry system of western Honduras. Field mesocosms were established with two earthworm treatments (0 vs. 8 Pontoscolex corethrurus individuals per mesocosm) and four litter quality treatments: (1) low-quality Zea mays, (2) high-quality Diphysa robinioides, (3) a mixture of low- and high-quality litters, and (4) a control with no organic residues applied. Mesocosms included a single Z. mays plant and additions of 15N-labeled inorganic nitrogen. At maize harvest, surface soils (0-15 cm) in the mesocosms were sampled to determine total and available P as well as the distribution of C, N, and 15N among different aggregate-associated SOM pools. Maize plants were divided into grain and non-grain components and analyzed for total P, N, and 15N. Earthworm additions improved soil structure as demonstrated by a 10% increase in mean weight diameter and higher C and N storage within large macro-aggregates (>2000 microm). A corresponding 17% increase in C contained in micro-aggregates within the macro-aggregates indicates that earthworms enhance the stabilization of SOM in these soils; however, this effect only occurred when organic residues were applied. Earthworms also decreased available P and total soil P, indicating that earthworms may facilitate the loss of labile P added to this system. Earthworms decreased the recovery of fertilizer-derived N in the soil but increased the uptake of 15N by maize by 7%. Litter treatments yielded minimal effects on soil properties and plant growth.

94,"MA4","The role of earthworms in soil fertility","Sudhanshu Singh","Deshans Chaudhary ","The soil biota benefits soil productivity and contributes to the sustainable function of all ecosystems. The cycling of nutrients is a critical function that is essential to life on earth. Earthworms (EWs) are a major component of soil fauna communities in most ecosystems and comprise a large proportion of macro-fauna biomass. The earthworms are the biological indicator of the soil ecosystem as they indicate the health and fertility of the soil for proper cropping. They enhance the nutrients contents, increase water holding capacity, and improve microbial activity in the soil. Their activity is beneficial because it can enhance soil nutrient cycling through the rapid incorporation of detritus into mineral soils. In addition to this mixing effect, mucus production associated with water excretion in earthworm guts also enhances the activity of other beneficial soil microorganisms. So, in the short term, a more significant effect is the concentration of large quantities of nutrients (N, P, K, and Ca) that are easily assailable by plants in fresh cast depositions. In addition, earthworms seem to accelerate the mineralization as well as the turnover of soil organic matter. Earthworms are known also to increase nitrogen mineralization, through direct and indirect effects on the microbial community. All over the world approximately 3627 species of earthworms are there. Earthworms are of two type's micrdrilli and megadrilli, in microdrilli group about 280 species, and the rest all are under megadrilli. Megadrilli group earthworms are soil living earthworms; they are grouped under three subgroups epigeic, endogeic, and anecic. The increased transfer of organic C and N into soil aggregates indicates the potential for earthworms to facilitate soil organic matter stabilization and accumulation in agricultural systems, and that their influence depends greatly on differences in land management practices.","Feb 2023","N/A","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368571784_ROLE_OF_EARTHWORM_IN_SOIL_FERTILITY_CROP_IMPROVEMENT_AND_MAINTENANCE_THROUGH_THE_PRODUCTION_OF_BIOGENIC_STRUCTURES_IN_SOIL?_sg=vBRQaJYtyG-VhgphaVKsun_O0GlIlGw7Tlol1rEL16uNda3g1EBBpSGIoEfaZFxwBnkU6dYc8l-34Rg"

Decomposer-mediated changes in plant growth and insect pest performance were investigated in wheat–aphid model systems in the greenhouse. Three types of litter distribution were established: litter patch at the soil surface (simulating mulching), litter patch deeper in soil (simulating ploughing) and litter homogeneously mixed into soil (simulating disk cultivation). The litter was labelled with 15N to follow the mineralization and uptake of nutrients by the plants. Earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and Collembola (Protaphorura armata) were included as representatives of major functional groups of decomposers. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was planted and aphids (Rhophalosiphum padi) were introduced to leaves as one of the most important pests. Earthworms, Collembola and litter distribution affected plant growth, N acquisition and aphid development in an interactive way. Earthworms and Collembola increased biomass of seeds, shoots and roots of wheat. Increased plant growth by earthworms and Collembola was mainly due to increased transfer of N from soil (rather than litter) into plants. Despite increasing plant growth, earthworms reduced aphid reproduction. Aphid reproduction was not correlated closely with plant N concentrations, but rather with the concentration of litter N in wheat. Unexpectedly, both Collembola and earthworms predominantly affected the mobilization of N from soil organic matter, and by altering the distribution of litter earthworms reduced infestation of crops by aphids via reducing plant capture of litter N, in particular if the litter was concentrated deeper in soil. The results suggest that management practices stimulating a continuous moderate increase in nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter rather than nutrient flushes from decomposing fresh organic matter result in maximum plant growth with minimum plant pest infestation.","Oct 2008","DOI: 10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51428073_Earthworms_Collembola_and_residue_management_change_wheat_Triticum_aestivum_and_herbivore_pest_performance_Aphidina_Rhophalosiphum_padi?_sg=Q4XPsCA1cnJ4gv9SGeckHQB3JqdMaC2_fdwEmV4i5t-YYw6NZ1lS_2ovx1Gm8cgnFF5Cg49c4gsPWGU"

We established model grassland communities in a greenhouse to study the interrelationship between two different functional groups of decomposer invertebrates, Lumbricidae and Collembola, and their effect on plant performance and plant nitrogen uptake in a plant diversity gradient. Common plant species of Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands were transplanted into microcosms with numbers of plant species varying from one to eight and plant functional groups varying from one to four. Separate and combined treatments with earthworms and collembolans were set up. Microcosms contained 15N labeled litter to track N fluxes into plant shoots. Presence of decomposers strongly increased total plant and plant shoot biomass. Root biomass decreased in the presence of collembolans and even more in the presence of earthworms. However, it increased when both animal groups were present. Also, presence of decomposers increased total N concentration and 15N enrichment of grasses, legumes, and small herbs. Small herbs were at a maximum in the combined treatment with earthworms and collembolans. The impact of earthworms and collembolans on plant performance strongly varied with plant functional group identity and plant species diversity and was modified when both decomposers were present. Both decomposer groups generally increased aboveground plant productivity through effects on litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization leading to an increased plant nutrient acquisition. The non-uniform effects of earthworms and collembolans suggest that functional diversity of soil decomposer animals matters and that the interactions between soil animal functional groups affect the structure of plant communities.","Nov 2006","DOI: 10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2548:DLCAPP]2.0.CO;2","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6706927_Decomposers_Lumbricidae_Collembola_affect_plant_performance_in_model_grasslands_of_different_diversity?_sg=VSrBJuDkiwzzbFO1Nl-ghcIg3lzVuWnw_TY4begvmWw2c1ErWqBPa_udjC0cRfDt9NpD10sk77OM5NA"

Earthworm biomass was sustained at 40g m-2 fw (ca. 3 g ash-free dry mass) on the average with peak values of 80 g at harvests 2 and 3 in treatments receiving an application of legume green manure. At the 6th harvest, earthworm biomass was significantly lower in the treatment with no organic input than in treatments with crop residues and legume green manure. Earthworm activities did not prevent C and nutrient stocks from being significantly depleted although P, K and Ca concentrations tended to be higher than in non-inoculated treatments at the 6th harvest. Plant production was significantly increased by 36% due to earthworm inoculation in a traditional low-input rotation (maize, rice, cowpea, rice, rice, rice) with variation between - 43 and + 78%, depending on the crop and climatic conditions. In a continuous maize culture that received fertilizers for the last three crops, grain production was increased by 2.45-fold on average, due to earthworm inoculation.

Further observations were recorded by Hensen in 1877. Agricultural chemists did not, however, generally make use of any of this work, and it was not till 1881 that the publication of Darwin's Earthworms and Vegetable Mould directed so much attention to the subject that the action of earthworms could no longer be disregarded.

Hefin Jones","Effects of Collembola (Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus scotarius) and earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion tyrtaeum) on the growth of two plant species from different functional groups (Poa annua and Trifolium repens), and on the development of aphids (Myzus persicae) were investigated in a laboratory experiment lasting 20 weeks. Using soil from a fallow site which had been set aside for about 15 years, we expected that nitrogen would be of limited supply to plants and hypothesized that the soil animals studied, particularly earthworms, would increase nutrient availability to plants and thereby also modify aphid reproduction and development. Plant growth was modified strongly by the presence of soil animals. Earthworms caused a more than twofold increase in shoot and root mass of P. annua but increased that of T. repens by only 18% and 6%, respectively. However, earthworms neither affected plant shoot/root ratio nor the nitrogen concentration in plant tissue. In contrast, the presence of Collembola caused a reduction in plant biomass particularly that of P. annua roots, but plant tissue nitrogen concentration was increased, although only slightly. Aphid reproduction on T. repens was lowered in the presence of Collembola on average by 45% but on P. annua increased by a factor of about 3. It is concluded that Collembola decrease aphid reproduction on more palatable host plants like T. repens but increase that on less palatable ones like P. annua. Earthworm presence also affected aphid reproduction but the effect was less consistent than that of Collembola. In the presence of earthworms, aphid reproduction was in one experimental period increased by some 70%. Earthworms also modified the numbers of Collembola and their vertical distribution in experimental chambers. Exploitation of deeper soil layers by H. nitidus was increased but, generally, O. scotarius numbers were reduced whereas those of H. nitidus increased in earthworm treatments. The presence of Collembola also influenced earthworm body mass during the experiment. In general it declined, but in the presence of Collembola loss of body mass of A. caliginosa was more pronounced. We conclude that inhibiting effects between Collembola and earthworms resulted from the use of a common resource, litter material rich in nitrogen. This is supported by the higher C/N ratio of the litter material in the presence of earthworms and Collembola by the end of the experiment. Effects of soil invertebrates like Collembola and earthworms on plant performance and aphid development are assumed to be modified by complex direct and indirect interactions among soil animal groups.","Jun 1999","DOI: 10.1007/s004420050817","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225741988_Links_between_the_detritivore_and_the_herbivore_system_Effects_of_earthworms_and_Collembola_on_plant_growth_and_aphid_development?_sg=ESMyV898Jg5uzLOYkKZ9p8dX-dY2wIIvoLoP1xceiJh_NLieNzkVyUSPEEQrpMsTSEfAC5awEbcz1Ic"

Stevens","G. N. Warren","Dense infestations of a peregrine oligochaete worm, Eukerria saltensis (Beddard), have been linked to rice crop failures in southern New South Wales, Australia. The influence of E. saltensis on water quality and rice plant establishment was investigated in a series of laboratory experiments using a flooded Riverina clay soil. Worm densities of 20 and 40 per container (2548 and 5096 worms/m, respectively) significantly increased water turbidity after 7 days incubation. Longer incubation periods led to turbidity levels of over 500 NTU being achieved (40 worms per container, 21 days incubation). Water pH was significantly reduced by densities of 10, 20, and 40 worms per container after 7 days under cyclical illumination, however in continuous darkness significant changes in pH related to worm density were only found after 21 days incubation. Nitrogen as NH4+ and total phosphorus increased significantly in the overlying water in response to increasing worm densities after 21 days incubation, however nitrogen as nitrate/nitrite and soluble phosphorus did not. Algal production (measured as extracted chlorophyll a concentration) was unaffected by the worms, reflecting the low concentrations of available phosphorus in all treatments. Rice plants grown in containers with worms produced significantly longer and heavier shoots than control plants. Root systems were unaffected, and there was no evidence of root abrasion. Evaluation of rice seed stratification in the soil profile indicates that rice seeds can be passively transported below the soil surface by the feeding and tunnelling activity of E. saltensis. Our results suggest that E. saltensis impedes the establishment of aerially-sown rice crops primarily by increasing water turbidity. Plants respond to high turbidity by partitioning more of their growth into shoot production, and consequently become vulnerable touprooting through wave action, particularly as the soil loses compaction because of worm activity. Maintaining the lowest possible water levels during rice crop establishment has helped farmers to minimize these effects.","Jan 2000","DOI: 10.1080/09670870050206082","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233233542_Laboratory_studies_on_the_influence_of_the_earthworm_Eukerria_saltensis_Beddard_Oligocheta_Ocnerodrilidae_on_overlying_water_quality_and_rice_plant_establishment?_sg=5stX_T8C1KMzGxhWdqOr-FWUt3w94vBDnrEUWKnVR9Ag73sKqDyHSpSZnz7lYDBvoWpYbNvLIvG-qw8"

Methods We conducted a full-factorial mesocosm study to investigate the individual and combined impacts of above- and belowground functionally dissimilar organisms on a grassland plant community. We studied the effects of aboveground herbivores (Helix aspersa, Gastropoda), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomus spp., Glomeromycota) and endogeic earthworms (Aporrectodea spp., Lumbricidae) on the diversity, structure and productivity of an experimental grassland plant community and each other. Important Findings Aboveground herbivory by snails decreased, AMF increased and earthworms had no effects on the diversity of the grassland plant community, while their combined effects were additive. The biomass of the plant community was negatively affected by snails and AMF, while no effects of earthworms or interaction effects were found. The plant species were differently affected by snails and AMF. No effects of the above- and belowground organisms on each other’s performance were detected.

In a greenhouse experiment we investigated effects of earthworms and spatial distribution of (15)N-labelled grass litter on plants of different functional groups [ Lolium perenne (grass), Plantago lanceolata (forb), Trifolium repens (legume)]. Earthworms enhanced shoot and root growth in L. perenne and P. lanceolata and N uptake from organic litter and soil in all plant species. Litter concentrated in a patch (compared with litter mixed homogeneously into the soil) increased shoot biomass and (15)N uptake from the litter in L. perenne and enhanced root proliferation in P. lanceolata when earthworms were present. Growth of clover (T. repens) was rather independent of the presence of earthworms and organic litter distribution: nevertheless, clover took up more nitrogen in the presence of earthworms and exploited more (15)N from the added litter than the other plant species. The magnitude of the effects of earthworms and organic litter distribution differed between the plant species, indicating different responses of plants with contrasting root morphology. Aphid (Myzus persicae) reproduction was reduced on P. lanceolata in the presence of earthworms. We suggest that earthworm activity may indirectly alter plant chemistry and hence defence mechanisms against herbivores.","Oct 2003","DOI: 10.1007/s00442-003-1329-x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10676112_Effects_of_earthworms_and_organic_litter_distribution_on_plant_performance_and_aphid_reproduction?_sg=B9TbubWWVAcjoJiOPmcU-hrGcKshMLzzCcKVFgSSGFfIA6GIfMVsyBGlBLguxv9kB1SzVd6wwfDq0nU"
111,"MA4","Earthworms counterbalance the negative effect of microorganisms on plant diversity and enhance the tolerance of grasses to nematodes","Susanne Wurst","Wim H. Van Der Putten","Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non-leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, but Lotus corniculatus flowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant-feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities.","Mar 2008","DOI: 10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16333.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227793950_Earthworms_counterbalance_the_negative_effect_of_microorganisms_on_plant_diversity_and_enhance_the_tolerance_of_grasses_to_nematodes?_sg=m8OCF5bFauveD0Q46aVkzMRiqYxySi9tREABArH1Eyk65csvDb_NoMd4rbpAmVxFKNeAwPPzjh-aeBE"
112,"MA4","Independent effects of arbuscular mycorrhiza and earthworms on plant diversity and newcomer plant establishment","Susanne Wurst","Matthias C. Rillig","Questions: How do arbuscular mycorrhiza and earthworms affect the structure and diversity of a ruderal plant community? Is the establishment success of newcomer plants enhanced by these soil organisms and their interactions? Methods: We grew a native ruderal plant community composed of different functional groups (grasses, legumes and forbs) in the presence and absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and endogeic earthworms in mesocosms. We introduced seeds of five, mainly exotic, plant species from the same functional groups after a disturbance simulating mowing. The effects of the soil organisms on the native ruderal plant community and seedling establishment of the newcomer plants were assessed. Results: After disturbance, the total above-ground regrowth of the native plant community was not affected by the soil organisms. However, AMF increased plant diversity and shoot biomass of forbs, but decreased shoot biomass of grasses of the native plant community. Earthworms led to a reduction in total root biomass. Establishment of the introduced newcomer plants increased in the presence of AMF and earthworms. Especially, seedling establishment of the introduced non-native legume Lupinus polyphyllus and the native forb Plantago lanceolata was promoted in the presence of AMF and earthworms, respectively. The endogeic earthworms gained more weight in the presence of AMF and led to increased extraradical AMF hyphal length in soil. However, earthworms did not seem to modify the effect of AMF on the plant community. Conclusion: The present study shows the importance of mutualistic soil organisms in mediating the establishment success of newcomer plants in a native plant community. Mutualistic soil organisms lead to changes in the structure and diversity of the native plant community and might promote newcomer plants, including exotic species.","Jul 2011","DOI: 10.1111/j.1654-1103.2011.01321.x","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230538701_Independent_effects_of_arbuscular_mycorrhiza_and_earthworms_on_plant_diversity_and_newcomer_plant_establishment?_sg=oI-HSLiczc3_jqPMlta6iy3LbeNQX3YU9u60_2fSiCZ70uj1OQvN88Qu0OVG6m14hW6imjZaPoXuUfA"
113,"MA4","Earthworm and soil moisture effects on the productivity and structure of grassland communities","J.G Zaller","J.A Arnone","Earthworms make up the dominant fraction of the biomass of soil animals in most temperate grasslands and have important effects on the structure and function of these ecosystems. We hypothesized that the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil moisture and plant biomass production would increase earthworm activity, expressed as surface cast production. Using a screen-aided CO2, control facility (open top and open bottom rings), eight 1.2-m(2) grassland plots in Switzerland have been maintained since March 1994 at ambient CO2 concentrations (350 mu l CO2 l(-1)) and eight at elevated CO2 (610 mu l CO2 l(-1)). Cumulative earthworm surface cast production measured 40 times over 1 year (April 1995-April 1996) in plots treated with elevated CO2 (2206 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1)) was 35% greater (P<0.05) than that measured in plant communities maintained at ambient CO2 (1633 g dry mass m(-2) year(-1)). At these rates of surface cast production, worms would require about 100 years to egest the equivalent of the amount of soil now found in the Ah horizon (top 15 cm) under current ambient CO2 concentrations, and 75 years under elevated CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO2 had no influence on the seasonality of earthworm activity. Cumulative surface cast production measured over the 7-week period immediately following the 6-week summer dry period in 1995 (no surface casting) was positively correlated (P<0.05) with the mean soil water content calculated over this dry and subsequent wetter period, when viewed across all treatments. However, no correlations were observed with soil temperature or with annual aboveground plant biomass productivity. No CO2-related differences were observed in total nitrogen (N-tot) and organic carbon (C-org) concentration of surface casts, although concentrations of both elements varied seasonally. The CO2-induced increase in earthworm surface casting activity corresponded to a 30% increase of the amount of N-tot (8.9 mg N m(-2) vs. 6.9 mg N m(-2)) and C-org (126 mg C m(-2) vs. 94 mg C m(-2)) egested by the worms in one year. m Thus, our results demonstrate an important indirect stimulatory effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on earthworm activity which may have profound effects on ecosystem function and plant community structure in the long term.","Jul 1997","DOI: 10.1007/s004420050232","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225082091_Activity_of_surface-casting_earthworms_in_a_calcareous_grassland_under_elevated_atmospheric_CO2?_sg=o1lXzTMp1OaEilEGuEV5WB_QwRfAfYv6-ayxWkf93ceryQtzgsUjGzCab5OgT825S-jO8tThAYffIfk"

Zaller","Thomas Drapela","Both earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important ecosystem engineers co-occurring in temperate grasslands. However, their combined impacts during grassland establishment are poorly understood and have never been studied. We used large mesocosms to study the effects of different functional groups of earthworms (i.e., vertically burrowing anecics vs. horizontally burrowing endogeics) and a mix of four AMF taxa on the establishment, diversity and productivity of plant communities after a simulated seed rain of 18 grassland species comprising grasses, non-leguminous forbs and legumes. Moreover, effects of earthworms and/or AMF on water infiltration and leaching of ammonium, nitrate and phosphate were determined after a simulated extreme rainfall event (40 l m(-2)). AMF colonisation of all three plant functional groups was altered by earthworms. Seedling emergence and diversity was reduced by anecic earthworms, however only when AMF were present. Plant density was decreased in AMF-free mesocosms when both anecic and endogeic earthworms were active; with AMF also anecics reduced plant density. Plant shoot and root biomass was only affected by earthworms in AMF-free mesocosms: shoot biomass increased due to the activity of either anecics or endogeics; root biomass increased only when anecics were active. Water infiltration increased when earthworms were present in the mesocosms but remained unaffected by AMF. Ammonium leaching was increased only when anecics or a mixed earthworm community was active but was unaffected by AMF; nitrate and phosphate leaching was neither affected by earthworms nor AMF. Ammonium leaching decreased with increasing plant density, nitrate leaching decreased with increasing plant diversity and density. In order to understand the underlying processes of these interactions further investigations possibly under field conditions using more diverse belowground communities are required. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that belowground-aboveground linkages involving earthworms and AMF are important mediators of the diversity, structure and functioning of plant communities.","Dec 2011","DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0029293","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51981628_Earthworm-Mycorrhiza_Interactions_Can_Affect_the_Diversity_Structure_and_Functioning_of_Establishing_Model_Grassland_Communities?_sg=avlN-mV7P4sI2BtUX7CrYCVjGtDeIlpIClAlq6hVPzBUl7X3CgI18UYYZvzz2hBIqbxA1TH9gdDb6hc"

Frank","Both earthworms and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) often co-occurr in ecosystems, however very little is known on their interrelationships. Here we tested to what extent earthworms (Annelida) or AMF (Glomales) separately or in combination affect the growth of the pharmaceutical plant species, pot marigold (Calendula officinalis, Asteraceae). We conducted a greenhouse experiment using non-sterilized field soil where we manipulated the factors earthworms (addition/no addition of the vertical burrowing species Lumbricus terrestris) and AMP (addition/no addition of a mix of the four Glomus taxa G. geosporum, G. mosseae, G. intraradices, G. claroideum). Leaf length and flower stem length was significantly increased by earthworms but remained unaffected by additional AMF. The longest leaves and flower stems were observed in pots containing earthworms but no additional AMF. The number of flower buds was unaffected by earthworms but marginally significantly increased by AMF. Plant shoot biomass production was significantly higher when earthworms were present; AMF inoculation had no effect on biomass production. Root biomass production and total plant biomass production remained unaffected by earthworms or AMP. These results indicate that in soil already containing AMP earthworm addition primarily affects vegetative growth while additional AMP inoculation tended to affect reproductive plant parts.","Mar 2011","DOI: 10.17221/189/2011-PSE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225082096_Effects_of_earthworms_and_mycorrhizal_fungi_on_the_growth_of_the_medicinal_herb_Calendula_officinalis_Asteraceae?_sg=XhwhX0GOQuvfife36Z8gUntMa6Zp5tf6oi-8l8HF3LTnCsltAFrxR1h1dpSWKTIUbFmKATf2I6DFNN4"
