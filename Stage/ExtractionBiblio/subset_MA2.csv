"Earthworms affect plant growth and resistance against herbivores: A meta-analysis","Zhenggao Xiao","Sergio Rasmann","Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities. A number of recent studies have explored whether these changes caused by earthworms may in turn affect plant performance and resistance to herbivores, but no formal synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a meta‐analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY ","en",2017,"Nov","China","France","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12969","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various"," detritivore diversity;endogeic earthworms;herbivore-feeding guilds;meta-analysis;plant growth-defence trade-off;plant nutrients;plant resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The mineral nutrition of wild plants revisited: A re-evaluation of processes and patterns.","R. Aerts","F.S. Chapin","In this chapter, the advances that have been made in understanding the ecology of the mineral nutrition of wild plants from terrestrial ecosystems have been reviewed. This chapter is organized along three lines. First, the issues of nutrient-limited plant growth and nutrient uptake, with special emphasis on the importance of the uptake of nutrients in organic form—both by mycorrhizal and by non-mycorrhizal plants—and the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is treated. In addition, the influence of allocation patterns on mineral nutrient uptake is described. Next, a few of the nutritional aspects of leaf functioning and how nutrients are used for biomass production by the plant are explored. That is done by studying the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) of plants and the various components of NUE. Finally, the feedback of plant species to soil nutrient availability by reviewing patterns in litter decomposition and nutrient mineralization is investigated. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the various aspects of the mineral nutrition of wild plants. The chapter ends with a conceptual description of plant strategies with respect to mineral nutrition (Publisher summary).","ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH ","en",2000,"Jan","The Netherlands","France","10.1016/s0065-2504(08)60016-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0065-2504(08)60016-1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Wordlwide (« terrestrial ecosystems »)","Various","Keywords + : NUTRIENT-USE EFFICIENCY;RELATIVE GROWTH-RATE;NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY;SIMULATED ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE;LEAF-LITTER DECOMPOSITION;ABOVE-GROUND PRODUCTIVITY;ALASKAN TUSSOCK TUNDRA;LIFE-SPANERIOPHORUM-VAGINATUM;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Macroevolution of plant defense strategies.","Anurag A. Agrawal","Anurag A. Agrawal","Theories of plant defense expression are typically based on the concepts of tradeoffs among traits and of phylogenetic conservatism within clades. Here, I review recent developments in phylogenetic approaches to understanding the evolution of plant defense strategies and plantherbivore coevolutionary interactions. I focus particularly on multivariate defense against insect herbivores, which is the simultaneous deployment of multiple traits, often arranged as convergently evolved defense syndromes. Answering many of the outstanding questions in the biology of plant defense will require generating broad hypotheses that can be explicitly tested by using comparative approaches and interpreting phylogenetic patterns. The comparative approach has wide-spread potential to reinvigorate tests of classic hypotheses about the evolution of interspecific interactions.","TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","en",2007,"Feb","USA","USA","10.1016/j.tree.2006.1012","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2006.10.012","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Brazil","Amazonian forests","Keywords + : HABITAT SPECIALIZATION;SECONDARY METABOLITES;ADAPTIVE RADIATION;AMAZONIAN FORESTS;CHEMICAL DEFENSE;YOUNG LEAVES;TRADE-OFFS;HOST SHIFT;HERBIVORES;EVOLUTION"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworm functional traits and interspecific interactions affect plant nitrogen acquisition and primary production.","Walter S. Andriuzzi","Thomas Bolger","We performed a greenhouse experiment to test how the functional diversity of earthworms, the dominant group of soil macro-invertebrates in many terrestrial ecosystems, affects nitrogen cycling and plant growth. Three species were chosen to represent a range of functional traits: Lumbricus terrestris (large, mainly detritivorous, makes vertical permanent burrows open at the surface), Aporrectodea longa (medium-large, feeds on both detritus and soil, makes burrows more branched than L. terrestris), and Allolobophora chlorotica (small, geophagous, makes ephemeral burrows below the soil surface). Mesocosms with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were inoculated with none to all three species (similar total biomass), using an experimental design (Simplex) suited to partition single species and diversity effects. Two contrasting N sources, urea or mammalian dung, were labelled with N-15 so that the acquisition by plants and earthworms and recovery of applied N-15 could be estimated.  Over 3 months, plant production was higher with urea applications, but there were also species-specific earthworm effects: A. chlorotica and, to a lesser extent, A. longa increased shoot biomass, whereas L. terrestris increased root biomass. Earthworms did not affect soil N concentrations or leaching losses, whereas more N was leached under urea. A. chlorotica tended to increase dung-N-15 recovery in grass shoots, but in interaction with A. longa had the opposite effect, possibly through increased N immobilization in the microbial biomass. Earthworms assimilated negligible amounts of urea-N-15 but a substantial proportion (17% on average) of the dung-N-15, with no clear-cut differences between species. Our findings show that earthworm species may have similar trophic response to N sources and yet different effects on plant N uptake and primary production, and that inter-specific earthworm interactions can result in non-additive diversity effects.

"Potential impact of soil microbiomes on the leaf metabolome and on herbivore feeding behavior.","Dayakar V. Badri","Jorge M. Vivanco","It is known that environmental factors can affect the biosynthesis of leaf metabolites. Similarly, specific pairwise plant–microbe interactions modulate the plant's metabolome by stimulating production of phytoalexins and other defense‐related compounds. However, there is no information about how different soil microbiomes could affect the plant growth and the leaf metabolome.We analyzed experimentally how diverse soil microbiomes applied to the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana were able to modulate plant growth and the leaf metabolome, as assessed by GC‐MS analyses. Further, we determined the effects of soil microbiome‐driven changes in leaf metabolomics on the feeding behavior of Trichopulsia ni larvae.Soil microbiomes differentially impacted plant growth patterns as well as leaf metabolome composition. Similarly, most microbiome‐treated plants showed inhibition to larvae feeding, compared with unamended control plants. Pyrosequencing analysis was conducted to determine the soil microbial composition and diversity of the soils used in this study.Correlation analyses were performed to determine relationships between various factors (soil microbial taxa, leaf chemical components, plant growth patterns and insect feeding behavior) and revealed that leaf amino acid content was positively correlated with both microbiome composition and insect feeding behavior.","NEW PHYTOLOGIST ","en",2013,"Apr","USA","USA","10.1111/nph.12124","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12124","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","USA, France, Sweden","Toulon, Revinghed, Portage, Fort Collins, Poudre Park, Camp Sherman, Hooper, Blanca, Monte Vista.","Arabidopsis;insect feeding;leaf metabolome;plant growth;soil microbiomes "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Experimental evidence that soil fauna enhance nutrient mineralization and plant nutrient uptake in montane grassland ecosystems.","Richard D Bardgett","Kin F Chan","This microcosm study is concerned with understanding those factors which regulate ecosystem processes of nutrient cycling and plant productivity in a montane grassland ecosystem. We examined the effects of different groups of soil fauna, namely bacterial-feeding nematodes and Collembola, on nutrient mineralization (N and P) in an acid, organic soil taken from a montane grassland in the Peak District National Park, United Kingdom. We also examined whether faunal influences on nutrient release, a measure of nutrient mineralization, resulted in changes in nutrient uptake and biomass production of an indigenous montane grass species (Nardus stricta (L.)). We found that in the presence of Collembola, and when nematodes and Collembola were combined, N mineralization, nutrient leaching and shoot N contents of N. stricta was significantly increased relative to a defaunated control. We also found that net P mineralization and leaching increased (although not significantly) in the presence of both nematodes and Collembola, resulting in a significant increase in shoot P content of N. stricta. The presence of nematodes alone, which were largely bacterial-feeders, had no effect on the mineralization of N or P, or shoot nutrient content. We suggest that differences in the effect of faunal treatments on nutrient mineralization are related to the feeding strategies of the added fauna, and to their consequent effect on the size of the soil microbial biomass. The treatments that increased N mineralization and plant nutrient content (N and P) also significantly reduced plant growth (shoot and root). We suggest that high NH4+-N concentrations in the soil solution of Collembola treatments inhibited the growth of N. stricta and that the growth of other grassland species may benefit from this improvement in nutrient availability.

"Using meta-regression to explore moderating effects in surveys of international achievement.","T. Benton ","T.

"Earthworm services for cropping systems.","Michel Bertrand","Jean Roger-Estrade","Abstract : Intensive agriculture is often criticized for negative impacts on environment and human health. This issue may be solved by a better management of organisms living in crop fields. Here, we review the benefits of earthworms for crops, and we present techniques to increase earthworm abundance. The major points are the following: (1) Earthworms usually improve soil structural stability and soil porosity and reduce runoff. (2) Earthworms modify soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrient cycling. Specifically, earthworms stabilize SOM fractions within their casts, and they also increase the mineralization of organic matter in the short term by altering physical protection within aggregates and enhancing microbial activity. (3) The positive correlation between earthworm abundance and crop production is not systematic, and contrasting effects on yields have been observed. Earthworms induce the production of hormone-like substances that improve plant growth and health. (4) Direct drilling increases earthworm abundance and species diversity, but the beneficial effect of reduced tillage depends upon the species present and tillage intensity. (5) Organic amendments enhance earthworm abundance. (6) Earthworms feeding at soil surface are the most exposed to pesticides and other agrochemicals. Finally, we discuss how to combine management practices, including inoculation, to increase the earthworm services. We conclude that using earthworm services in cropping systems has potential to boost agricultural sustainability.","AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ","en",2015,"Apr","France","France","10.1007/s13593-014-0269-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0269-7","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A ","Earthworms;Tillage;Pesticides;Mineralization;Belowground-aboveground interactions;Soil structure;Crop pathogens and parasites;Ecosystem services "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Role of earthworms in soil fertility maintenance through the production of biogenic structures.","Tunira Bhadauria","Krishan Gopal Saxena","Abstract : The soil biota benefits soil productivity and contributes to the sustainable function of all ecosystems. The cycling of nutrients is a critical function that is essential to life on earth. Earthworms (EWs) are a major component of soil fauna communities in most ecosystems and comprise a large proportion of macrofauna biomass. Their activity is beneficial because it can enhance soil nutrient cycling through the rapid incorporation of detritus into mineral soils. In addition to this mixing effect, mucus production associated with water excretion in earthworm guts also enhances the activity of other beneficial soil microorganisms. This is followed by the production of organic matter. So, in the short term, a more significant effect is the concentration of large quantities of nutrients (N, P, K, and Ca) that are easily assimilable by plants in fresh cast depositions. In addition, earthworms seem to accelerate the mineralization as well as the turnover of soil organic matter. Earthworms are known also to increase nitrogen mineralization, through direct and indirect effects on the microbial community. The increased transfer of organic C and N into soil aggregates indicates the potential for earthworms to facilitate soil organic matter stabilization and accumulation in agricultural systems, and that their influence depends greatly on differences in land management practices. This paper summarises information on published data on the described subjects.","Applied and Environmental Soil Science ","en",2010,"Dec","India","India","10.1155/2010/816073","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2010/816073","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Worldwide","« All ecosystems »","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"A review of earthworm impact on soil function and ecosystem services.","M. Blouin","J.‐J.

In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed ‘ecosystem engineers’. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate.

"Belowground organism activities affect plant aboveground phenotype, inducing plant tolerance to parasites.","Manuel Blouin","Patrick Lavelle","Soil fauna activities are probably more important than currently acknowledged in determining individual plant response to stresses and overall plant diversity. Here we demonstrate that the positive effect of earthworms on rice could be the result of a systemic effect on plant physiology. Moreover, this effect could improve tolerance to stressors such as parasitic nematodes. In a controlled experiment, an 82% decrease in the production of infested plants was suppressed when earthworms were present. Earthworms had no direct effect on nematode population size. In their presence, however, root biomass was not affected by nematodes and the expected inhibition of photosynthesis was suppressed. In the leaves, the expression of three stress‐responsive genes (coding for lipoxygenase, phospholipase D and cysteine protease) was modulated by the presence of belowground invertebrate activities. We document conflicting systemic effects of parasitic nematodes and beneficial earthworms, although we cannot precisely identify the mechanism involved.

"Interactive effects of functionally different earthworm species on aggregation and incorporation and decomposition of newly added residue carbon.","Heleen Bossuyt","Paul F. Hendrix","The interactive effects of two functionally different earthworm species (Aporrectodea caliginosa (endogeic species) and Lumbricus rubellus (epigeic species)) on the incorporation of fresh residue into large macroaggregates and formation of microaggregates within these large macroaggregates were investigated during a short-term laboratory experiment using C-13-labelled sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) residues. Soil was collected from a long-term no-tillage agricultural field, crushed through a 250-mu m sieve and incubated under laboratory conditions. The following earthworm treatments were applied: (i) soil+ C-13-labelled residue+A. caliginosa; (ii) soil+ C-13-labelled residue+L. rubellus; (iii) Soil+ C-13-labelled residue+A. caliginosa+L. rubellus and; (iv) soil+ C-13-labelled residue. Two residue placement treatments (i.e. surface and incorporated) were superimposed on the earthworm treatments. Earthworms were added after 8 days of incubation. Aggregate size distribution and total C and C-13 were measured after 22 days. Microaggregates, fine inter-microaggregate particulate organic matter (inter-POM) and intra-microaggregate POM (intra-POM) were isolated from macroaggregates. Earthworms had a greater stimulating effect on the formation of large macroaggregates (> 2000 mu m) and microaggregates within large macroaggregates when residue was incorporated in the soil, especially in the presence of A. caliginosa. When residue was placed on the surface, residue-derived intra-POM C was highest when L. rubellus was present and significantly lower in the presence of A. caliginosa. Residue-derived inter-POM C was highest when a mix of both species was present. These results indicate that earthworm species differentially affect incorporation of fresh organic matter into stable microaggregates within macroaggregates, and that interactive effects of earthworm species might have important consequences for the incorporation and protection of C inside of microaggregates within macroaggregates especially when residues are placed on the soil surface.

In the presence of earthworms, we observed a significant decrease in populations of P. zeae in the rhizosphere of Oryza sativa after 6 weeks (1st generation), and 12 weeks (2nd generation), respectively, in comparison to a control with no earthworms. A parallel experiment with H. sacchari and P. corethrurus showed that H. sacchari cysts were ingested by earthworms with the soil, and the interaction between the gut and the gut contents of P. corethrurus and H. sacchari showed that i) populations of cysts had decreased 5 weeks (1st generation) after the start of the experiment, and ii) the total number of eggs and infesting larvae (J2 alive) had decreased.

"How earthworms affect plant growth: Burrowing into the mechanisms.","George G Brown"," C.A. Edwards ","Earthworm populations show a considerable amount of variability in time and space, with mean population densities and biomass ranging from fewer than 10 individuals and 1 g m–2, respectively, to more than 1000 individuals and 200 g m–2, respectively, under favorable conditions. However, within particular climatic zones, earthworm assemblages, with fairly characteristic species richness, composition, abundance, and biomass, can often be recognized in broadly different habitat types, such as coniferous forests, deciduous woodland, grassland, and arable land. There is a considerable volume of literature describing the earthworm communities of such habitats, and much of this was summarized by Lee (1985) and updated by Edwards and Bohlen (1996). There is also a considerable amount of information describing the influence of various environmental and management factors on earthworm populations, but in comparison with insects, for which the population ecology of 92many species has been subjected to quantitative analysis, earthworm population ecology is still largely at a descriptive stage. Population modeling has been used for particular purposes such as risk assessment (Baveco and De Roos 1996), but development of realistic models of field populations has been hindered by a lack of information on key life history parameters and the factors that influence them.","Earthworm Ecology","en",2004,"Mar","Brazil","England","10.1201/9781420039719-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781420039719-9","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Worldwide","Various","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Analysis of wheat resistance to the cereal aphid Sitobion avenae using electrical penetration graphs and flow charts combined with correspondence analysis.","Claudia M. Caillaud","J. P. Di Pietro","The behaviour of Sitobion avenae (F.) was compared on resistant wheat lines of Triticum monococcum (L.) and a susceptible variety of Triticum aestivum (L.). Firstly, stylet penetration activities were monitored with the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique and subsequently analysed using flow charts combined with correspondence analysis. Plant resistance was shown to be associated with repeated penetrations without access to either the xylem or the phloem, and with numerous failures in starting a sustained sap ingestion (as represented by pattern E2). Access to sieve elements of the phloem did not seem to be much affected on resistant plants but it took the aphid three times as long to produce a sap ingestion pattern when maintained on the resistant line T. monococcum n ° 44 (Tm44) as compared with aphids maintained on susceptible plants. As a result the total time spent in ingesting from sieve elements was reduced by 72% on Tm44. Secondly, direct observations of freely‐moving apterous adults were performed. Aphids did not discriminate between resistant and susceptible wheat during the first 30 min of access to test leaves, but only 4 out of 25 aphids were still probing after eight hours on resistant Tm44.The relevance of these results to possible location of the resistance factor(s) are discussed. Although detection of plant resistance before sieve elements are reached can not be rigorously excluded, the factors involved in T. monococcum resistance to S. avenae undoubtedly occur within the phloem vessels.","ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA ","en",1995,"Apr","USA","France","10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01904.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01904.x","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","Homoptera sitobion avenae;triticum monococcum;resistance mechanisms;probing behaviour;electronic monitoring;flow charts;correspondence analysis"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The green peach aphid Myzus persicae perform better on pre-infested Chinese cabbage Brassica pekinensis by enhancing host plant nutritional quality","He-He Cao","Tong-Xian Liu","The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer, is a notorious pest on vegetables, which often aggregates in high densities on crop leaves. In this study, we investigated whether M. persicae could suppress the resistance level of Chinese cabbage Brassica pekinensis. M. persicae performed better in terms of weight gain (~33% increase) and population growth (~110% increase) when feeding on previously infested (pre-infested) Chinese cabbage compared with those on non-infested plants. However, when given a choice, 64% of the aphids preferred to settle on non-infested leaves, while 29% of aphids chose pre-infested leaves that had a 2.9 times higher concentration of glucosinolates. Aphid feeding significantly enhanced the amino acid:sugar ratio of phloem sap and the absolute amino acid concentration in plant leaves. Aphid infestation significantly increased the expression levels of salicylic acid (SA) marker genes, while it had marginal effects on the expression of jasmonate marker genes. Exogenously applied SA or methyl jasmonate had no significant effects on M. persicae performance, although these chemicals increased glucosinolates concentration in plant leaves. M. persicae infestation increase amino acid:sugar ratio and activate plant defenses, but aphid performed better on pre-infested plants, suggesting that both nutrition and toxics should be considered in insect-plant interaction.","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ","en",2016,"Feb","China","China","10.1038/srep21954","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep21954","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","China","N/A","Keywords +: AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION;ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA;PHLOEM-SAP;GENE-EXPRESSION;SALICYLIC-ACID;JASMONIC ACID;DEFENSE;GLUCOSINOLATES;SENESCENCE;HERBIVORES"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Resource availability and plant antiherbivore defense.","Phyllis D. Coley","F. Stuart Chapin","The degree of herbivory and the effectiveness of defenses varies widely among plant species. Resource availability in the environment is proposed as the major determinant of both the amount and type of plant defense. When resources are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses.

"Soil animals and pedogenesis: The role of earthworms in anthropogenic soils.","Luis Cunha","Peter Kille","The role of earthworms as one of the most important groups of ecosystem engineers in human-modified and natural environments has been increasingly recognized only during the last 30 years, yet earthworms and humans have been acting together in building landscapes for millennia. This relationship is well represented in the pre-Columbian raised fields, in flood-prone savannas around the rim of Amazonia, but also by the potentially significant role of earthworms in the formation and resilience of Amazonian Dark Earths. Through the bioturbating action of earthworms, soil is biologically, chemically, and physically altered; nutrients are translocated; organic matter is decomposed and transformed; and the surrounding biota interacts as a large orchestra where the soil musicians play together on the various instruments but where earthworms take a leading role, enhancing microbial activity and generally stimulating plant growth. In this article, we assess the remarkable role of earthworms at the center of soil pedogenetic processes within anthropogenic landscapes, dissecting their functions with a special focus on Amazonian Dark Earths.","Soil Science ","en",2016,"Apr","Portugal ","Colombia","10.1097/SS.0000000000000144","http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ss000000000000144","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Brazil","Amazonia","Amazonia;Amazonian Dark Earths;bioturbation;earthworms;nutrient cycling;soil formation"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The feeding ecology of earthworms – A review. ","James P. Curry","Olaf Schmidt","Current knowledge of earthworm feeding ecology is reviewed, with particular reference to food selection, ingestion, digestion and assimilation, and the use of novel techniques to advance understanding of the functional significance of these processes.  Traditional research methods including direct observation of feeding behaviour, gut content analysis, choice tests, and litter bags have provided a wealth of information on earthworm feeding. However, there is a lack of the mechanistic, quantitative information required to characterise adequately their functional role in soil ecosystem processes such as soil C sequestration and loss, decomposition of organic residues, the maintenance of soil structure and trophic interactions with plants and microorganisms.  Stable isotope ratio analysis of light elements (C, N, and S) offers a powerful research tool to reveal and quantify trophic relationships of earthworms in soil food webs, while molecular techniques can further enhance understanding of the interactions between earthworms and microorganisms and their functional significance.","Pedobiologia","en",2007,"Jan","Ireland","Ireland","10.1016/j.pedobi.2006901","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedobi.2006.09.001","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A ","oligochaeta;food preferences;ingestion;assimilation;earthworm;microbial interactions;stable isotopes"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Earthworms as drivers of the competition between grasses and legumes.","Nico Eisenhauer","S. Scheu","Grasses and legumes are grown together worldwide to improve total herbage yield and the quality of forage, however, the causes of population oscillations of grasses and legumes are poorly understood. Especially in grasslands, earthworms are among the most important detritivore animals functioning as ecosystem engineers, playing a key role in nutrient cycling and affecting plant nutrition and growth. The objectives of the present greenhouse experiment were to quantify the effects of earthworms on grass–legume competition in model grassland systems at two harvesting dates – simulating the widespread biannual mowing regime in Central European grasslands.  The presence of earthworms increased the productivity of grasses and legumes after 6 weeks but only that of grasses after another 10 weeks. In mixed treatments, the presence of grasses and earthworms decreased legume shoot biomass, the amount of nitrogen (N) in shoot tissue and the number of legume flowerheads while the presence of legumes and earthworms increased the amount of N in grass shoots and the infestation of grasses with aphids. Analyses of 15N/14N ratios indicate that, compared to legumes, grasses more efficiently exploit soil mineral N and benefit from legume presence through reduced “intra-functional group” competition. In contrast to previous experiments, we found no evidence for N transfer from legumes to grasses. However, legume presence improved total herbage and N yield.  Earthworms likely modulate the competition between grasses and legumes by increasing soil N uptake by plants and thereby increasing the competitive strength of grasses. Earthworms function as essential driving agents of grass–legume associations by (I) increasing grass yield, (II) increasing the amount of N in grass hay, (III) increasing the infestation rate of grasses with aphids, and (IV) potentially reducing the attractiveness of grass–legume associations to pollinators.","Soil Biology and Biochemistry","en",2008,"Jul","USA","USA","10.3410/f.1123874.580974","http://dx.doi.org/10.3410/f.1123874.580974","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Jena, Thuringia","Above-ground–below-ground interactions Aphid infestation Competition Flowering success Grassland Lumbricus terrestris Nitrogen uptake Quality of forage Stable isotopes The Jena Experiment"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The role of protein effectors in plantaphid interactions.","Dezi A Elzinga","Georg Jander","Aphid salivary proteins, which are injected into the phloem sieve elements during feeding, play a central role in plant–aphid interactions. Among the dozens of known salivary proteins, many have no homology to proteins from other organisms. These aphid-specific proteins likely have evolved as effectors that inhibit plant defenses, prevent phloem sieve-element occlusion, and otherwise promote the unique phloem feeding style. However, aphid salivary proteins also are recognized by plants to mount defense responses and are likely a major factor in limiting the host range of particular aphid species and biotypes. Newly developed research tools provide excellent opportunities for analyzing the mostly unknown functions of aphid salivary proteins and elucidating their contribution to the complex interactions between aphids and their host plants.","Current Opinion in Plant Biology","en",2013,"Aug","USA","USA","10.1603/ice.2016.106255","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2013.06.018","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The growth-defense trade-off and habitat specialization by plants in Amazonian forests.","Paul V. A. Fine","Phyllis D. Coley","Tropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has led to specialization in plants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-rich clay forests surround nutrient-poor white-sand forests, each harboring a unique composition of habitat specialist trees. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong natural selection for plant defenses in white-sand forest, while rapid growth is favored in clay forests. Recently, we reported evidence from a reciprocal-transplant experiment that manipulated the presence of herbivores and involved 20 species from six genera including phylogenetically independent pairs of closely related white-sand and clay specialists. When protected from herbivores, clay specialists exhibited faster growth rates than white-sand specialists in both habitats. But, when unprotected, white-sand specialists outperformed clay specialists in white-sand habitat, and clay specialists outperformed white-sand specialists in clay habitat.  Here we test further the hypothesis that the growth-defense trade-off contributes to habitat specialization by comparing patterns of growth, herbivory, and defensive traits in these same six genera of white-sand and clay specialists. While the probability of herbivore attack did not differ between the two habitats, an artificial defoliation experiment showed that the impact of herbivory on plant mortality was significantly greater in white-sand forests. We quantified the amount of terpenes, phenolics, leaf toughness, and available foliar protein for the plants in the experiment. Different genera invested in different defensive strategies, and we found strong evidence for phylogenetic constraint in defense type. Overall, however, we found significantly higher total defense investment for white-sand specialists, relative to their clay specialist congeners. Furthermore, herbivore resistance consistently exhibited a significant trade-off against growth rate in each of the six phylogenetically independent species-pairs.  These results confirm theoretical predictions that a trade-off exists between growth rate and defense investment, causing white-sand and clay specialists to evolve divergent strategies. We propose that the growth-defense trade-off is universal and provides an important mechanism by which herbivores govern plant distribution patterns across resource gradients.","ECOLOGY ","en",2006,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[150:tgtahs]2.co;2","https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87%5B150:tgtahs%5D2.0.co;2","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Peru","Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve near Iquitos","Amazon;ecological gradient;growth-defense trade-off;habitat specialization;herbivory;phenolics;phylogenetic control;rainforest;reciprocal-transplant experiment;terpenes;tropical trees "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of Allelochemicals from First (Brassicaceae) and second (Myzus persicae and Brevicoryne brassicae) trophic levels on Adalia bipunctata.","Frédéric Francis","Eric Haubruge","The Brevicoryne brassicae aphid is an important pest of several plants of the Brassicaceae family worldwide. In the Mantaro Valley-Peru, it causes economic losses in cabbage and broccoli crops. Myzus persicae is the most important pest in potato cultivation. Myzaphis rosarum colonizes both wild and cultivated rose bushes and trees. To control it, farmers use toxic chemical insecticides that cause health problems. Faced with this problem, biocontrol is an important component of sustainable production to control pests. Hippodamia convergens is a predator of aphids, so it is necessary to know its biology and predation in its different prey. The objective was to determine the duration of the development stages, longevity, fecundity and performance of the predator H. convergens reared with cabbage aphids B. barssicae, Myzaphis rosarum and Myzus persicae. The completely randomized design was used, with 10 repetitions and three treatments or species of aphids. The aphid species used as food for the predator influenced the duration of preimaginal and adult development. Egg-adult development was longer with 34.1 days with B. brassicae and shorter with M. rosarum and M. persicae with 22.8 and 22.5 days respectively.

"The dilemma of plants: To grow or defend.","Daniel A. Herms","Wu Mattson","Physiological and ecological constraints play key roles in the evolution of plant growth patterns, especially in relation to defenses against herbivores. Phenotypic and life history theories are unified within the growth-differentiation balance (GDB) framework, forming an integrated system Of theories explaining and predicting patterns of plant defense and competitive interactions in ecological and evolutionary time.  Plant activity at the cellular level can be classified as growth (cell division and enlargement) of differentiation (chemical and morphological changes leading to cell maturation and specialization). The GDB hypothesis of plant defense is premised upon a physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes. The trade-off between growth and defense exists because secondary metabolism and structural reinforcement are physiologically constrained in dividing and enlarging cells, and because they divert resources from the production of new leaf area. Hence the dilemma of plants: They must grow fast enough to compete, yet maintain the defenses necessary to survive in the presence of pathogens and herbivores.  The physiological trade-off between growth and differentiation processes interacts with herbivory and plant-plant competition to manifest itself as a genetic trade-off between growth and defense in the evolution of plant life history strategies. Evolutionary theories of plant defense are reviewed. We also extend a standard growth rate model by separating its ecological and evolutionary components, and formalizing the role of competition in the evolution of plant defense. We conclude with a conceptual model of the evolution of plant defense in which plant physiological trade-offs interact with the abiotic environment, competition and herbivory.","QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ","en",1992,"Sep","USA","USA","10.1086/417659","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/417659","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A ","Keyword + : CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE;CYNOGLOSSUM-OFFICINALE;LOTUS-CORNICULATUS;LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION;LOW NUTRITIVE QUALITY;SENECIO-JACOBAEA;INSECT HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS;TISSUE-SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTION;SHRUB OEMLERIA-CERASIFORMIS;PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms influence the production of above and belowground biomass and the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ulrike Jana","Anne Repellin","To better understand the complex mechanisms of action of earthworms on plants, we set up an experimental system using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heynh, Aporrectodea caliginosa a common temperate earthworm and two types of soil with contrasted contents in organic matter and nutrients. Changes in plant biomass, biomass allocation to roots, leaves and stems and C/N ratios were related to variations in the expression of several plant genes involved in cellular division and stress responses and with earthworm-induced alterations in soil mineral status.  In the poorest soil, i.e. with low contents in mineral nutrient and organic matter, earthworms increased soil nitrate content very significantly and boosted plant aboveground biomass production. This correlated with changes in leaf transcript accumulation suggesting enhanced cell division and lesser incidence of reactive oxygen species. In the richer soil, earthworms had no significant effect on the production of aerial biomass. However, several plant responses were observed regardless of soil quality: enhanced accumulation of an auxin-responsive transcript in the leaves, a strong decrease in root length and biomass and a reduction in C/N values, particularly in the bolt stems. Although these results pointed out earthworm-induced enhancement of mineralization as a determining factor in the formidable plant growth responses, the release in the drilosphere of phytohormone-like compounds by earthworm-activated bacteria was most likely implicated as well in this process and resulted in ""forced"" nitrogen uptake by the plants. The herein demonstrated sensitivity of the model plant A. thaliana to earthworms shows that such new experimental set up could become a central key to the development of multidisciplinary investigations on plant-soil interactions.

"Evolutionary ecology of plant defences against herbivores.","Marc T. J. Johnson","Marc T. J. Johnson"," 1. Herbivores consume a large portion of the biomass produced by plants in virtually all ecosystems, which has dramatic effects on both the ecology and evolution of plants. In response to this threat, plants have evolved a diverse arsenal of direct and indirect defences to reduce herbivory and the impacts of damage on plant performance. 2. This special feature is a broad synthesis of the evolution and ecology of plant defences. The first objective of this special feature is to provide a review of what we have learned about plant defences against herbivores. The second objective is to stimulate debate and sow fresh ideas for the future research. 3. The 11 articles in this issue address three fundamental questions: (i) How do plants defend themselves against a diverse array of enemies? (ii) Why do plant species vary in defence? And (iii) What are the ecological and ecosystem‐level consequences of plant defence? In addressing these questions the articles cover the interdisciplinary nature of plant–herbivore evolutionary ecology, from genes to global patterns. 4. The articles contained in the special feature question existing paradigms and provide new analyses of data. In some cases, influential hypotheses are firmly supported with new analyses (e.g. the Resource Availability Hypothesis), whereas in other instances conventional wisdom is called into question (e.g. the importance of secondary metabolites in the microevolution of resistance) and popular hypotheses are rejected (e.g. the Apparency Hypothesis, the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis). 5. This is an exciting time for research on the evolutionary ecology of plant defences.

"Plant mediated effects of soil invertebrates and summer drought on above-ground multitrophic interactions.","Scott N. Johnson","Susan E. Hartley"," 1. We conducted a large‐scale field study to determine how the interactive effects of earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and summer drought affected plant communities containing barley (Hordeum vulgare), shepherd’s purse (Capsella bursa‐pastoris) and common groundsel (Senecio vulgaris), and how such effects then influenced populations of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and its parasitoid, Aphidius ervi. 2. Total biomass of plant communities decreased by around 25% with summer drought, but was increased by the presence of earthworms by over 11%. The effects of drought and earthworms on H. vulgare differed in monocultures and mixed plant communities. In monocultures, earthworms had the biggest impact, increasing plant biomass, but drought had the biggest effect in multi‐species communities, causing a decrease in biomass. 3. Drought had an extremely negative impact on S. vulgaris shoot and root biomass, but this was ameliorated in the roots when earthworms were present. Capsella bursa‐pastoris was not significantly affected by drought or earthworms. Drought caused a significant increase in shoot nitrogen concentrations in all plants, including H. vulgare (from 19.2 to 23.8 mg g−1). 4. In total, 35 234 aphids were recorded, of which 3936 were parasitized. Drought conditions reduced aphid abundance by over 50%. The interaction was moderated by earthworms, which caused further declines in R. padi populations under drought conditions, most notably in monocultures. 5. The plant‐mediated effects of drought and earthworms (negative and positive, respectively) on R. padi had cascading effects on the parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, which declined in abundance with reduced numbers of R. padi. In addition, drought had a negative impact on A. ervi abundance beyond its impacts on aphid density, suggesting reduced prey quality as well as quantity. 6.;;Synthesis. This study demonstrated the effect of predicted climate change (i.e. reduced summer rainfall) on plant‐mediated interactions between earthworms and above‐ground multitrophic groups.

Many previous studies have investigated the relationship between soil biodiversity and aboveground plants, but few researches have considered the indirect interaction between soil biota and above-ground aphids. In this study the individual effects of Aporrectodea rosea and Allolobophora chlorotica and the combined effects of A. rosea and A. chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis, and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, Lumbricus rubellus and S. mammalis on plant morphology and physiology and aphid development (nymphs day-1, fecundity and number of adults) were investigated. Plant growth was affected by the presence of A. rosea which caused increases in plant biomass, height of plant, leaf surface area and specific leaf area (SLA). Mean number of leaves per plant was unaffected by worm density. In contrast, increasing density of A. chlorotica had no effect on any aspect of plant performance. The combined effect of A. rosea and A. chlorotica resulted in a similar increase in plant biomass to A. rosea alone. While the combined effects of A. caliginosa and Satchellius mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis and A. rosea, A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis caused increases in all plant parameters except leaf number. Additionally, the individual effect of A. rosea and the combined effects of A. caliginosa and S. mammalis, A. chlorotica & S. mammalis and A. rosea and A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis resulted in increased in leaf nitrogen concentration. Aphid development was also affected by the presence of earthworms. The nymphs day-1, fecundity and numbers of adults were significantly increased with increases in earthworm densities. The interaction between all groups of earthworms and their influence on aphid growth showed that the combined effect of two different groups was greater than the individual groups. Proteomic techniques were used to compare protein patterns in the plants. The combined effects of A. caliginosa and S. mammalis, A. chlorotica and S. mammalis, A. rosea, A. caliginosa, L. rubellus and S. mammalis earthworms on plant resulted in differences in number and kind of protein between plant treated with earthworms and the control, but no significant difference in proteins volume.

"Induced responses to herbivory. ","Richard Karban","Ian T.

But although plants cannot flee from their attackers, they are far from defenseless. In addition to adaptations like thorns, which may be produced in response to attack, plants actively alter their chemistry and physiology in response to damage. For instance, young potato plant leaves being eaten by potato beetles respond by producing chemicals that inhibit beetle digestive enzymes.  Over the past fifteen years, research on these induced responses to herbivory has flourished, and here Richard Karban and Ian T.

"Herbivore diet breadth and host plant defense mediate the tri-trophic effects of plant toxins on multiple coccinellid predators.","Angelos Katsanis","Kailen A. Mooney","Host plant defenses are known to cascade up food chains to influence herbivores and their natural enemies, but how herbivore and predator traits and identity mediate such tri-trophic dynamics is largely unknown. We assessed the influence of plant defense on aphid and coccinellid performance in laboratory trials with low-vs. high-glucosinolate varieties of Brassica napus, a dietary specialist (Brevicoryne brassicae) and generalist (Myzus persicae) aphid, and five species of aphidophagous coccinellids. The performance of the specialist and generalist aphids was similar and unaffected by variation in plant defense. Aphid glucosinolate concentration and resistance to predators differed by aphid species and host plant defense, and these effects acted independently. With respect to aphid species, the dietary generalist aphid (vs. specialist) had 14% lower glucosinolate concentration and coccinellid predators ate three-fold more aphids. With respect to host plant variety, the high-glucosinolate plants (vs. low) increased aphid glucosinolate concentration by 21%, but had relatively weak effects on predation by coccinellids and these effects varied among coccinellid species. In turn, coccinellid performance was influenced by the interactive effects of plant defense and aphid species, as the cascading, indirect effect of plant defense was greater when feeding upon the specialist than generalist aphid. When feeding upon specialist aphids, low-(vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by 78% and accelerated development by 14%. In contrast, when feeding upon generalist aphids, low-(vs. high-) glucosinolate plants increased coccinellid mass gain by only 11% and had no detectable effect on development time. These interactive effects of plant defense and aphid diet breadth on predator performance also varied among coccinellid species; the indirect negative effects of plant defenses on predator performance was consistent among the five predators when transmitted via the dietary specialist aphid, but these effects varied substantially among predators-in both the magnitude and directionwhen transmitted via the dietary generalist aphid. Accordingly, the cascading effect of plant defense on predators was stronger in magnitude and more consistent among predator taxa when transmitted by the specialist than generalist herbivore. Overall, these findings support a central role of herbivore diet breadth in mediating both the strength and contingency of tri-trophic interactions.","PLOS ONE ","en",2016,"May","USA","USA","10.1371/journal.pone155716","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0155716","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","Keywords+: INSECT HERBIVORES;BREVICORYNE-BRASSICAE;IRIDOID GLYCOSIDES;MYZUS-PERSICAE;HIGH-MORTALITY;SLOW-GROWTH;BEHAVIOR;SPECIFICITY;EVOLUTION;ECOLOGY"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms, collembola and residue management change wheat (Triticum aestivum) and herbivore pest performance (Aphidina: Rhophalosiphum padi).","Xin Ke","Stefan Scheu","Management practices of arable systems determine the distribution of soil organic matter thereby changing decomposer animal activity and their impact on nutrient mineralization, plant growth and plant–herbivore interactions. Decomposer-mediated changes in plant growth and insect pest performance were investigated in wheat–aphid model systems in the greenhouse. Three types of litter distribution were established: litter patch at the soil surface (simulating mulching), litter patch deeper in soil (simulating ploughing) and litter homogeneously mixed into soil (simulating disk cultivation). The litter was labelled with 15N to follow the mineralization and uptake of nutrients by the plants. Earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and Collembola (Protaphorura armata) were included as representatives of major functional groups of decomposers. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was planted and aphids (Rhophalosiphum padi) were introduced to leaves as one of the most important pests. Earthworms, Collembola and litter distribution affected plant growth, N acquisition and aphid development in an interactive way. Earthworms and Collembola increased biomass of seeds, shoots and roots of wheat. Increased plant growth by earthworms and Collembola was mainly due to increased transfer of N from soil (rather than litter) into plants. Despite increasing plant growth, earthworms reduced aphid reproduction. Aphid reproduction was not correlated closely with plant N concentrations, but rather with the concentration of litter N in wheat. Unexpectedly, both Collembola and earthworms predominantly affected the mobilization of N from soil organic matter, and by altering the distribution of litter earthworms reduced infestation of crops by aphids via reducing plant capture of litter N, in particular if the litter was concentrated deeper in soil. The results suggest that management practices stimulating a continuous moderate increase in nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter rather than nutrient flushes from decomposing fresh organic matter result in maximum plant growth with minimum plant pest infestation.","Oecologia","en",2008,"Jul","China","Germany","10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1106-y","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Darmstadt","Arable system;Heterogeneous rhizosphere;Detritivore;Litter decomposition;Nitrogen-15"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeding on Arabidopsis induces the formation of a deterrent indole glucosinolate.","Jae Hak Kim","Georg Jander","Cruciferous plants produce a wide variety of glucosinolates as a protection against herbivores and pathogens. However, very little is known about the importance of individual glucosinolates in plant defense and the regulation of their production in response to herbivory. When Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeds on Arabidopsis aliphatic glucosinolates pass through the aphid gut intact, but indole glucosinolates are mostly degraded. Although aphid feeding causes an overall decrease in Arabidopsis glucosinolate content, the production of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is induced. This altered glucosinolate profile is not a systemic plant response, but is limited to the area in which aphids are feeding. Aphid feeding on detached leaves causes a similar change in the glucosinolate profile, demonstrating that glucosinolate transport is not required for the observed changes. Salicylate‐mediated signaling has been implicated in other plant responses to aphid feeding. However, analysis of eds5, pad4, npr1 and NahG transgenic Arabidopsis, which are compromised in this pathway, demonstrated that aphid‐induced changes in the indole glucosinolate profile were unaffected. The addition of purified indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate to the petioles of cyp79B2 cyp79B3 mutant leaves, which do not produce indole glucosinolates, showed that this glucosinolate serves as a precursor for the aphid‐induced synthesis of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. In artificial diets, 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is a significantly greater aphid deterrent in the absence of myrosinase than its metabolic precursor indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. Together, these results demonstrate that, in response to aphid feeding, Arabidopsis plants convert one indole glucosinolate to another that provides a greater defensive benefit.","PLANT JOURNAL ","en",2007,"Mar","South Korea ","USA","10.1111/j.1365-313x.20063019.x","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313x.2006.03019.x ","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","USA","USDA Plant Soil and Nutrition Laboratory, Ithaca, NY","Arabidopsis;indole glucosinolate;Myzus persicae;aphid;defense "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Meta-analysis of sources of variation in fitness costs of plant antiherbivore defenses.","Julia Koricheva","Julia Koricheva","Plant defense theories predict that allocation to antiherbivore defenses should impose a cost on plants, manifested as a reduction in growth and reproduction. However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r = -0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r = -0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast. the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores. type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced). concentrations of defensive compounds. or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.","ECOLOGY ","en",2002,"Jan","England ","England","10.2307/2680130","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2680130","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","allocation costs;antiherbivore defense;ecological costs;meta-analysis;opportunity cost;strade-off "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of mycorrhizal fungi on insect herbivores: A meta-analysis.","Julia Koricheva","Tara Jones","Mycorrhizal status of the host plant is often ignored in studies on plant–herbivore interactions, but mycorrhizal colonization is known to induce many morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in host plants, which in turn may alter plant quality as a host for insect herbivores. Both positive and negative effects of mycorrhizal colonization of the host plant on performance and density of insect herbivores have been reported in previous studies. We have conducted a meta‐analysis of 34 published and unpublished studies on this topic in order to find out the sources of variation in mycorrhizae effects on insect herbivores. Effects of mycorrhizae on chewing insects depended upon the parameter measured and the degree of herbivore feeding specialization. Density and consumption of chewing insects were higher on mycorrhizal plants, but this did not lead to greater plant damage, presumably because herbivore survival tended to be lower on mycorrhizal plants. Mono‐ and oligophagous chewers benefited from mycorrhizal colonization of their host plants, whereas performance of polyphagous chewers was reduced on mycorrhizal plants. Among sucking insects, phloem feeders benefited from mycorrhizal infection, but performance of mesophyll feeders was lower on mycorrhizal plants. The type of mycorrhiza was not important for chewing insects, but performance of sucking insects was increased more by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) than by ectomycorrhizae (ECM). Among AM inoculation studies, the most commonly used fungal species,Glomus intraradices, tended to have a negative effect on chewer performance, whereas all other fungal species tended to have a positive effect. There was no significant difference in results between studies using inoculation and fungicides, field and laboratory studies, and published and unpublished studies. Mycorrhizal status of the host plant thus influences insect herbivore performance, but the magnitude and direction of the effect depend upon the feeding mode and diet breadth of the insect and the identity of fungi.","ECOLOGY ","en",2009,"Aug","England","England","10.1890/08-1555.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1555.1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","arbuscular mycorrhizae;ectomycorrhizae;feeding guilds;insect herbivores;meta-analysis;multitrophic interactions "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Effects of residue decomposition on productivity and soil fertility in rice–wheat rotation.","Yadvinder-Singh","C. S. Bueno","Rice (Oryza sativa L.)–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) farmers in India burn or remove residues to facilitate seedbed preparation. Incorporation of residues before planting of the next crop generally decreases yields due to N immobilization. Since a window of about 40 d is available between rice harvest and wheat planting, the effect of time of incorporation on rice residue decomposition and N mineralization–immobilization was studied in 1992–1993. The mass loss of residue was 25% for a 10‐d, 35% for a 20‐d, and 51% for a 40‐d decomposition period before wheat planting. Nitrogen release from residue ranged from 6 to 9 kg ha−1 during the wheat season. The immobilization of urea N decreased when residue was allowed to decompose for 10‐d or longer. Based on these studies, a long‐term (1993–2000) experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil to examine the effect of time of residue incorporation before sowing wheat when compared with burning or removal of residue on yields, N‐use efficiency, and soil fertility. The effect of wheat residue incorporation with green manure (GM, Sesbania cannabina L.) on subsequent rice yields was also determined. Residue incorporation for 10 to 40 d had no effect on wheat yields. Rice yields increased (0.18–0.39 Mg ha−1) when wheat residue was incorporated with GM. Starter N applied at residue incorporation did not influence wheat yields but decreased N recovery efficiency. Physiological efficiency was higher when rice straw was incorporated in wheat and when wheat straw plus GM were incorporated in rice than when rice straw was incorporated for 10 d or when the straw was burned. The long‐term application of rice residue increased C accumulation in soil.","SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL ","en",2004,"May","India","Philippines","10.2136/sssaj2004.8540","http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.8540","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","India ","research farm of the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana","Keywords +: BARLEY STRAW DECOMPOSITION;CROP RESIDUE;NITROGEN DYNAMICS;MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES;IMMOBILIZATION;QUALITY;TILLAGE;CARBON;YIELDS;CORN"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of an endogeic and an anecic earthworm on the competition between four annual plants and their relative fecundity.","Kam-Rigne Laossi","Sébastien Barot","Competition between plants for essential resources determines the distribution of biomasses between species as well as the composition of plant communities through effects on species reproductive potentials. Soil organisms influence plant competitive ability and access to resources: thus they should modify plant community composition. The effects of an endogeic (Aporrectodea caliginosa) and an anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) earthworm species on the competition between grass (Poa annual, two forbs (Veronica persica and Cerastium glomeratum) and legume (Trifolium dubium) were investigated in a greenhouse experiment. We established two types of plant communities: monocultures and polycultures of the four species. L terrestris increased the biomass of P. annua and V. persica (in monocultures as well as in polycultures). However, the presence of L terrestris allowed the grass to produce the highest biomass in polycultures suggesting that this earthworm species promoted the growth of P. annua against the other plant species. In monocultures as well as in polycultures, the presence of L terrestris to increased the number of seeds of T dubium and the total seed mass of V. persica. These results suggest that L terrestris enhanced the short term competitive ability of P. annua by promoting its growth. The increased number of seeds of T dubium in the presence of L terrestris suggests that this earthworm species could enhance the long-term competitive ability of this legume and may increase its number of individuals after several generations.

"Life-history constraints in grassland plant species: A growth-defence trade-off is the norm.","Eric M. Lind","Peter D. Wragg","Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting trade‐off possibilities. The competition‐defence hypothesis posits a trade‐off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth‐defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth‐defence trade‐off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life‐history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth‐defence trade‐off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.","ECOLOGY LETTERS ","en",2013,"Apr","USA","USA","10.1111/ele.12078","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12078","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","CH = Switzerland; CN = China; DE = Germany; TZ = Tanzania; ZA = South Africa.

"Decomposers and root feeders interactively affect plant defence in Sinapis alba.","Maité Lohmann","Caroline Müller","Aboveground herbivory is well known to change plant growth and defence. In contrast, effects of soil organisms, acting alone or in concert, on allocation patterns are less well understood. We investigated separate and combined effects of the endogeic earthworm species Aporrectodea caliginosa and the root feeding nematode species Pratylenchus penetrans and Meloidogyne incognita on plant responses including growth and defence metabolite concentrations in leaves of white mustard, Sinapis alba. Soil biota had a strong impact on plant traits, with the intensity varying due to species combinations. Nematode infestation reduced shoot biomass and nitrogen concentration but only in the absence of earthworms. Earthworms likely counteracted the negative effects of nematodes. Infestation with the migratory lesion-nematode P. penetrans combined with earthworms led to increased root length. Earthworm biomass increased in the presence of this species, indicating that these nematodes increased the food resources of earthworms-presumably dead and decaying roots. Nitrogen-based defence compounds, i.e. glucosinolates, did not correlate with nitrogen levels. In the presence of earthworms, concentrations of aromatic glucosinolates in leaves were significantly increased. In contrast, infection with P. penetrans strongly decreased concentrations of glucosinolates (up to 81%). Infestation with the sedentary nematode M. incognita induced aromatic glucosinolates by more than 50% but only when earthworms were also present. Myrosinase activities, glucosinolate-hydrolysing enzymes, were unaffected by nematodes but reduced in the presence of earthworms. Our results document that root-feeding nematodes elicit systemic plant responses in defence metabolites, with the responses varying drastically with nematode species of different functional groups. Furthermore, systemic plant responses are also altered by decomposer animals, such as earthworms, challenging the assumption that induction of plant responses including defence traits is restricted to herbivores. Soil animals even interact and modulate the individual effects on plant growth and plant defence, thereby likely also influencing shoot herbivore attack.","OECOLOGIA ","en",2009,"Mar","Germany","Germany","10.1007/s00442-009-1306-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1306-0","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Kiepenkerl, Norken,","Multitrophic interactions;Brassicaceae;Glucosinolate;Myrosinase;Induction "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"How earthworm activities affect banana plant response to nematodes parasitism.","G. Loranger-Merciris","H. Ozier-Lafontaine","The burrowing nematode Radopholus similis and the lesion nematodes Pratylenchus spp. are considered as major constraints to banana cultivation worldwide. As an alternative to the use of chemical pesticides in commercial banana plantations, the possible role of the earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus was studied regarding the reducing harmfulness of the main plant-feeding nematodes of banana. The interactions among banana plants, plant-feeding nematodes and earthworms have been tested in a controlled experiment combining treatments including or not earthworms and nematodes, over a complete vegetative banana development cycle. The aim of the work was to evaluate how earthworm activity can affect the pathogenicity of the three main plant-feeding nematodes associated with dessert banana (Musa spp. AAA group, cv. Cavendish) in Guadeloupe (French West Indies), R. similis, Pratylenchus coffeae and Helicotylenchus multicinctus.  Results showed that damages caused by plant-feeding nematodes were lowered in the presence of the earthworm P. corethrurus; the population of plant-feeding nematodes did not decrease whereas root damage induced by nematodes was significantly reduced (50% reduction of root necrosis in the presence of earthworms). Moreover, in the presence of P. corethrurus, we observed a change of soil porosity. On the one hand, the burrowing activity of earthworms destroyed most of the initial structural porosity (mesobiotic pores, 3-300 mu m) and on the other hand, they increased the volume of the finest structural pores diameter class (microbiotic pores, 0.3-3 mu m). P. corethrurus also stimulated phosphorus mineralization.  Soil bioturbation carried out by P. corethrurus could have enhanced the efficiency of microbial community that is involved in phosphorus bioavailability. This observation was corroborated by a higher phosphorus availability in earthworm casts (1386 +/- 38 mg 13 kg(-1) of dry matter in cast versus 778 +/- 61 mg P kg(-1) of dry matter in the soil compartment not influenced by earthworm activity), and a better plant phosphorus nutrition in the presence of earthworms. Phosphorus uptake resulted in a better plant nutrition and a better tolerance to plant-feeding nematodes. Besides, the reduction of the mesobiotic porosity by bioturbation could also have disturbed the nematodes activities during their soil phase and contributed to the reduction of their damage.","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY ","en",2012,"Jan","France","France ","10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.1003","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2011.10.003","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Guadeloupe, French West Indies","greenhouse at the INRA research station of Duclos, Petit-Bourg","Phosphorus uptake;Pontoscolex corethrurus;Radopholus similis;Pratylenchus coffeae;Helicotylenchus multicinctus;Pore size distribution "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The continuum of plant responses to herbivory: The influence of plant association, nutrient availability, and timing.","Joyce Maschinski","Thomas G. Whitham","In a single population of Ipomopsis arizonica (Polemoniaceae), we show a continuum of compensatory responses to vertebrate herbivory. We demonstrate experimentally that the degree of herbivore impact depends on plant association, nutrient availability, and timing of grazing. From 1985 to 1987, the most common response to vertebrate herbivory was equal compensation, whereby grazed plants set numbers of fruits and seeds equal to controls within the same growing season. However, we also observed cases of significant overcompensation and undercompensation. In 1985 and 1987, overcompensation occurred in vertebrate-grazed plants that were supplemented with nutrients and growing free of competition. These plants produced 33% to 120% more fruit than control, ungrazed plants. Cases of undercompensation occurred in groups where I. arizonica grew in association with grasses or where nutrients were not supplemented. Grazed and clipped plants in these groups produced from 28% to 82% as many fruits as did ungrazed controls. Our studies indicate that the compensatory response of plants to grazing is probabilistic when three external factors are considered. The probability of compensation for herbivory decreases as competition with other plants increases, as nutrient levels decrease, and as the timing of herbivory comes later in the growing season.","AMERICAN NATURALIST ","en",1989,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1086/284962","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/284962","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Potential effects of earthworms on leaf-chewer performance.","J. E. NEWINGTON","T. H.

There was no associated increase in plant biomass.There was no significant effect of earthworm treatment on the biomass of M. brassicae larvae.

"The evolution of resistance and tolerance to herbivores.","Eunice Kariñho-Betancourt","Juan Núñez-Farfán","Tolerance and resistance are two different plant defense strategies against herbivores. Empirical evidence in natural populations reveals that individual plants allocate resources simultaneously to both strategies, thus plants exhibit a mixed pattern of defense. In this review we examine the conditions that promote the evolutionary stability of mixed defense strategies in the light of available empirical and theoretical evidence. Given that plant tolerance and resistance are heritable and subject to environmentally dependent selection and genetic constraints, the joint evolution of tolerance and resistance is analyzed, with consideration of multiple species interactions and the plant mating system. The existence of mixed defense strategies in plants makes it necessary to re-explore the coevolutionary process between plants and herbivores, which centered historically on resistance as the only defensive mechanism. In addition, we recognize briefly the potential use of plant tolerance for pest management. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues for future development in this field of evolutionary ecology.","ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS","en",2015,"Mar","Mexico","Mexico","10.7717/peerj.789","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.789","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A","herbivory;adaptive evolution;EES;plant defenses;mixed defense strategies;costs and benefits of defense "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Differential costs of two distinct resistance mechanisms induced by different herbivore species in Arabidopsis. ","Nawaporn Onkokesung","Marcel Dicke","Plants respond to herbivory with the induction of resistance, mediated by distinct phytohormonal signaling pathways and their interactions. Phloem feeders are known to induce plant resistance via the salicylic acid pathway, whereas biting-chewing herbivores induce plant resistance mainly via the jasmonate pathway. Here, we show that a specialist caterpillar (biting-chewing herbivore) and a specialist aphid (phloem feeder) differentially induce resistance against Pieris brassicae caterpillars in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Caterpillar feeding induces resistance through the jasmonate signaling pathway that is associated with the induction of kaempferol 3,7-dirhamnoside, whereas aphid feeding induces resistance via a novel mechanism involving sinapoyl malate. The role of sinapoyl malate is confirmed through the use of a mutant compromised in the biosynthesis of this compound. Caterpillar-induced resistance is associated with a lower cost in terms of plant growth reduction than aphid-induced resistance. A strong constitutive resistance against P. brassicae caterpillars in combination with a strong growth attenuation in plants of a transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutant of WRKY70 (wrky70) suggest that the WRKY70 transcription factor, a regulator of downstream responses mediated by jasmonate-salicylic acid signaling cross talk, is involved in the negative regulation of caterpillar resistance and in the tradeoff between growth and defense. In conclusion, different mechanisms of herbivore-induced resistance come with different costs, and a functional WRKY70 transcription factor is required for the induction of low-cost resistance.","PLANT PHYSIOLOGY","en",2016,"Feb","UK","The Netherlands","10.1104/pp.151780","https://doi.org/10.1104%2Fpp.15.01780","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","England","European Arabidopsis Stock Centre.","Keywords + : NDIRECT PLANT DEFENSE;JASMONIC ACIDSALICYLIC-ACID;TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR;SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION;GENE-EXPRESSION;GLUCOSINOLATE BIOSYNTHESIS;STRESS-RESPONSE;INSECT;ACCUMULATION"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Beneficial microbes in a changing environment: Are they always helping plants to deal with insects?","Ana Pineda","María J. Pozo","Plants have a complex immune system that defends them against attackers (e.g. herbivores and microbial pathogens) but that also regulates the interactions with mutualistic organisms (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth‐promoting rhizobacteria). Plants have to respond to multiple environmental challenges, so they need to integrate both signals associated with biotic and abiotic stresses in the most appropriate response to survive.Beneficial microbes such as rhizobacteria and mycorrhizal fungi can help plants to ‘deal’ with pathogens and herbivorous insects as well as to tolerate abiotic stress. Therefore, beneficial microbes may play an important role in a changing environment, where abiotic and biotic stresses on plants are expected to increase. The effects of beneficial microbes on herbivores are highly context‐dependent, but little is known on what is driving such dependency. Recent evidence shows that abiotic stresses such as changes in soil nutrients, drought and salt stress, as well as ozone can modify the outcome of plant–microbe–insect interactions.Here, we review how abiotic stress can affect plant–microbe, plant–insect and plant–microbe–insect interactions, and the role of the network of plant signal‐transduction pathways in regulating such interactions.Most of the studies on the effects of abiotic stress on plant–microbe–insect interactions show that the effects of microbes on herbivores (positive or negative) are strengthened under stressful conditions. We propose that, at least in part, this is due to the crosstalk of the different plant signalling pathways triggered by each stress individually. By understanding the cross‐regulation mechanisms we may be able to predict the possible outcomes of plant‐microbe–insect interactions under particular abiotic stress conditions. We also propose that microbes can help plants to deal with insects mainly under conditions that compromise efficient activation of plant defences.In the context of global change, it is crucial to understand how abiotic stresses will affect species interactions, especially those interactions that are beneficial for plants. The final aim of this review is to stimulate studies unravelling when these ‘beneficial’ microbes really benefit a plant.","Fonctional Ecology","en",2013,"Nov","The Netherlands","Spain","10.1111/1365-2435.12050","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12050","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","abiotic stress;abscisic acid;below- and above-ground interactions;climate change;cross-talk;induced systemic resistance;microbial symbiosis;mycorrhiza;plant growth promoting rhizobacteria;plant signalling  "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Editorial: Above-belowground interactions involving plants, microbes and insects.","Ana Pineda","Ted C. J. Turlings","“Integration” has become a central theme in plant research, and this concept has greatly contributed to the exciting recent advances of our understanding of plant interactions with their environment. Plants in nature interact with a plethora of organisms, from microbes and insects through vertebrates to other plants. While some organisms are detrimental, others have mutualistic interactions with plants. Whereas, plant responses to all these organisms were initially studied separately for aboveground and for belowground domains, nowadays it is accepted that plant interactions belowground orchestrate a cascade of events that affects the interactions of plants with organisms that live aboveground, and vice versa. In parallel, it has become evident that the plants' interactions with both mutualists and antagonists are governed by often similar phytohormonal and metabolic responses, which starting at the molecular level, shape the ecological interactions that take place in natural and agricultural systems. Beyond the fundamental interest in these interactions, a comprehensive understanding of how plants integrate their responses to microbes and insects below-aboveground, will also contribute to tackle applied concerns such as the development of sustainable crop protection strategies, and the development of novel crop varieties for increasing yield and performance. Integrating plant responses to beneficial and detrimental organisms, from microbes to insects, and using integrative approaches that range from the molecular changes within the plant to the ecological interactions taking place among organisms, will provide a more representative view of the multitude and complexity of interactions in nature. With this Research Topic, we aimed at being integrative, by proposing a wide array of themes, spanning papers dealing with the molecular bases of above-belowground plant-insect-microbe interactions, to more ecological and large-scale work.","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE ","en",2015,"May","The Netherlands","Sweden","10.3389/fpls.20150318","https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.00318/full","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","plant defenses;plant-insect interactions;beneficial microbes;root herbivores;signaling pathways;multitrophic interactions;phytohormones;induced resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Signal molecules mediate the impact of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa on growth, development and defence of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.","Ruben Puga-Freitas","Manuel Blouin","Earthworms have generally a positive impact on plant growth, which is often attributed to a trophic mechanism: namely, earthworms increase the release of mineral nutrients from soil litter and organic matter. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed since the discovery of a signal molecule (Indole Acetic Acid) in earthworm faeces. In this study, we used methodologies developed in plant science to gain information on ecological mechanisms involved in plant-earthworm interaction, by looking at plant response to earthworm presence at a molecular level. First, we looked at plant overall response to earthworm faeces in an in vitro device where only signal molecules could have an effect on plant growth; we observed that earthworms were inducing positive or negative effects on different plant species. Then, using an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with an impaired auxin transport, we demonstrated the potential of earthworms to stimulate root growth and to revert the dwarf mutant phenotype. Finally, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana in the presence and absence of earthworms; we found that genes modulated in the presence of earthworms are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, or to the application of exogenous hormones. A comparison of our results with other studies found in databases revealed strong analogies with systemic resistance, induced by signal molecules emitted by Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria and/or elicitors emitted by non-virulent pathogens. Signal molecules such as auxin and ethylene, which are considered as major in plant-microorganisms interactions, can also be of prior importance to explain plant-macroinvertebrates interactions.

The absence of plant genetic resistance and efficient fungicide against this disease calls for the development of alternative management strategies such as the use of biological control agents. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa can control this plant pathogen by changing soil pH, inducing plant defence mechanisms or improving plant nutrition. Towards this aim, soil chemical properties, plant production, morphology and transcriptome were assessed in the different treatments to characterize the effects of Ggt, earthworm and the interaction between them. Sixty three days after sowing, Ggt was responsible for a strong reduction in fine root proportion and leaf area, and an 82 % decrease in plant total biomass. Earthworms reduced infection rate by 63 % and improved plant growth, which was not significantly different from the no-pathogen control. Neither changes in soil pH, plant defence mechanisms or plant nutrition were proved to be involved in this effect. It was concluded that A. caliginosa was a very efficient biocontrol agent against Ggt and that the mechanism responsible for this biocontrol effect could be associated with microbial community modifications or fungal consumption by earthworms.","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY","en",2015,"Sep","France","France","10.1007/s10658-015-0759-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0759-8","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","France","N/A","Aporrectodea caliginosa;Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici;Defence mechanisms;Take-all;Transcriptome;Triticum aestivum (winter wheat)"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"Effects of life history, domestication and agronomic selection on plant defence against insects: Evidence from maizes and wild relatives.","Joshua P. Rosenthal","Rodolfo Dirzo","Plant domestication and agronomic selection for increased yield may have an associated effect of reducing plant defence against herbivorous insects. This hypothesis is based on evidence for a metabolic cost associated with defence, and on evidence that increases in yield generally come from the re-partitioning of photoassimilates rather than from fundamental increases in photosynthetic rates. We propose that for plants in which domestication and crop development constitute strong selection for increased growth and reproduction, reallocation of resources may result in lower defence against insects. We examine this hypothesis by means of comparative studies of growth, reproduction and resistance in a complex of maizes and closely related wild taxa, the teosintes. The results of these studies are consistent with assumptions of differential investment in growth and reproduction between wild and domesticated plants. A wild perennial grew slowest and had lowest grain production, while a modern cultivar grew fastest and had the highest grain yield. A wild annual and a land-race cultivar were intermediate. Damage from a diverse assemblage of folivorous insects, and from a specialist stemboring lepidopteran larva, fit the defence predictions closely. A gradient of attack levels suggests that the wild perennial is most defended, followed in descending order by the wild annual, the land-race cultivar and the modern high-yielding variety. Alternative hypotheses for this pattern are consistent with some, but not all, of our data.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",1997,"May","USA","USA","10.1023/a:1018420504439","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1018420504439","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Mexico","N/A","cost of defence;Diatraea grandiosella growth rate;Mexico;resource allocation;Zea spp"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

While subsequent damage levels, when corrected for differences in plant size, were highest in the wild perennial, Zea diploperennis, this taxon showed the lowest absolute and proportional reductions in growth and reproduction, i.e., it was most tolerant to the damage. Higher growth rates were not associated with tolerance. Rather, a greater number of tillers and leaves in the wild taxa allowed for compartmentalization of damage and greater developmental plasticity. These results, when combined with previous findings on effective defense patterns, indicate that tolerance in maizes and wild relatives may be positively associated with defense against stemboring by the same insect. Because the probable mechanisms for defense (tissue fiber) and tolerance (plant architecture) are unrelated, a positive association is contrary to the predictions of some optimal defense theories, which posit a negative relationship between tolerance and defense.","Oecologia","en",1995,"May","USA","USA","10.1007/bf00333245","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/bf00333245","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Mexico","southwest Mexico","Compensatory growth;Zea Domestication;Defense trade-offs;Stemborer"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of earthworms on plant growth: Patterns and perspectives.","Stefan Scheu","Stefan Scheu","A total of 67 studies were located in which the response of plants to presence of earthworms was investigated. The number of studies increased strongly during the last decade. in most of the studies (79%) shoot biomass of plants significanty increased in the presence of earthworms. However, knowledge on effects of earthworms on plant growth is very biased; most studies investigated crop plants, particularly cereals, and pastures; very little is known on plant species in more natural communities. Recently, interest in tropical plant species has increased considerably, however, the studies have considered almost exclusively agricultural plant species. Generally, experiments focused on the response of plant shoots but 45% of the studies also considered roots. Most of the studies investigated European earthworms (Lumbricidae); very little is known on other earthworm species. Some early studies indicated that earthworms affect the composition of plant communities but only very recently has it been documented that earthworms affect plant competition. However, there is virtually no information on how earthworms affect plant performance in detail including fitness parameters such as flowering and seed production. It has been realized recently that earthworms not only modify plant growth and vegetation structure but also the susceptability of plants to herbivores. Herbivore performance might be stimulated but also reduced due to the presence of earthworms. Furthermore, earthworms function as subsidiary food resources to generalist predators when herbivore prey is scarce. The complex indirect interactions between earthworms and the aboveground system deserve further investigation in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. The imperative for future research is adopting an ecological rather than an agricultural perspective in studying earthworm-plant interrelationships and viewing earthworms as driving factors of the aboveground food web. It is suggested that studies on earthworm-plant interactions may contribute significantly to a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial ecosystems and to the development of more environmentally friendly agricultural practices.","PEDOBIOLOGIA ","en",2003,"Jan","Germany","Germany","10.1078/0031-4056-00270","http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0031-4056-00270","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (67 studies)","Various","Lumbricidae;rhizosphere;animal-plant interactions;indirect effects;food-web"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Hefin Jones","Effects of Collembola (Heteromurus nitidus and Onychiurus scotarius) and earthworms (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion tyrtaeum) on the growth of two plant species from different functional groups (Poa anna and Trifolium repens), and on the development of aphids (Myzus persicae) were investigated in a laboratory experiment lasting 20 weeks. Using soil from a fallow site which had been set aside for about 15 years, we expected that nitrogen would be of limited supply to plants and hypothesized that the soil animals studied, particularly earthworms, would increase nutrient availability to plants and thereby also modify aphid reproduction and development. Plant growth was modified strongly by the presence of soil animals. Earthworms caused a more than twofold increase in shoot and root mass of P. annua but increased that of T. repens by only 18% and 6%, respectively. However, earthworms neither affected plant shoot/root ratio nor the nitrogen concentration in plant tissue. In contrast, the presence of Collembola caused a reduction in plant biomass particularly that of P. annua roots, but plant tissue nitrogen concentration was increased, although only slightly. Aphid reproduction on T. repens was lowered in the presence of Collembola on average by 45% but on P. annua increased by a factor of about 3. It is concluded that Collembola decrease aphid reproduction on more palatable host plants like T. repens but increase that on less palatable ones like P. annua. Earthworm presence also affected aphid reproduction but the effect was less consistent than that of Collembola. In the presence of earthworms, aphid reproduction was in one experimental period increased by some 70%. Earthworms also modified the numbers of Collembola and their vertical distribution in experimental chambers. Exploitation of deeper soil layers by H. nitidus was increased but, generally, O. scotarius numbers were reduced whereas those of H. nitidus increased in earthworm treatments. The presence of Collembola also influenced earthworm body mass during the experiment. In general it declined, but in the presence of Collembola loss of body mass of A. caliginosa was more pronounced. We conclude that inhibiting effects between Collembola and earthworms resulted from the use of a common resource, litter material rich in nitrogen. This is supported by the higher C/N ratio of the litter material in the presence of earthworms and Collembola by the end of the experiment. Effects of soil invertebrates like Collembola and earthworms on plant performance and aphid development are assumed to be modified by complex direct and indirect interactions among soil animal groups.","OECOLOGIA ","en",1999,"Jun","Germany","Wales","10.1007/s004420050817","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050817","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Germany","Göttingen ","soil fauna;soil food web;herbivores;Lumbricidae;springtails "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Insect-plant biology","Louis M Schoonhoven","Marcel Dicke","Half of all insect species are dependent on living plant tissues, consuming about 10% of plant annual production in natural habitats and an even greater percentage in agricultural systems, despite sophisticated control measures. Plants possess defences that are effective against almost all herbivorous insect species. Host-plant specialization, observed in over 80% of these animals, appears to be an effective adaptation to breach these defence systems. The mechanisms underlying plant defence to invading herbivores on the one side, and insect adaptations to utilize plants for nutrition, defence and shelter on the other, are the main subjects of this book. In the case of plants exposed to insect herbivores, they include the activation of defence systems in order to minimize damage, as well as the emission of chemical signals that may attract natural enemies of the invading herbivores and may be exploited by neighbouring plants that mount defences as well. For insects, they include complex bevioural adaptations and their underlying sensory systems (with their implications for learning and nutritional plasticity), as well as the endocrinological aspects of life cycle synchronization with host-plant phenology.  Insect-Plant Biology discusses the operation of these mechanisms at the molecular and organismal levels and explicitly puts these in the context of both ecological interactions and evolutionary processes. In doing so, it uncovers the highly intricate antagonistic as well as mutualistic interactions that have evolved between plants and insects. The book concludes with a chapter on the application of our knowledge of insect-plant interactions to agricultural production.  This multidisciplinary approach will appeal to students in biology, agricultural entomology, ecology, and indeed anyone interested in the principles underlying the relationships between the two largest groups of organisms on earth: plants and insects.","Book","en",2005,"Dec","The Netherlands ","The Netherlands ","10.1093/oso/978019852594301001","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31846359_Insect-Plant_Biology","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various ","Various","N/A"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Results: Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased earthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity and later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such as introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all changes, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether woodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on woodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during conversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil structure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group composition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on tillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were positively associated with soil microaggregate stability.  Conclusions: These findings raise the potential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation to regulation of soil structure and water flow.","BMC ECOLOGY ","en",2013,"Dec","UK","The Netherlands","10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-46","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (met-analysis)","Various","Meta analysis;Earthworm;Fungi;Functional biodiversity;Soil porosity;Microaggregate stability"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Plant interactions with multiple insect herbivores: From community to genes.","Jeltje M. Stam","Marcel Dicke","Every plant is a member of a complex insect community that consists of tens to hundreds of species that belong to different trophic levels. The dynamics of this community are critically influenced by the plant, which mediates interactions between community members that can occur on the plant simultaneously or at different times. Herbivory results in changes in the plant's morphological or chemical phenotype that affect interactions with subsequently arriving herbivores. Changes in the plant's phenotype are mediated by molecular processes such as phytohormonal signaling networks and transcriptomic rearrangements that are initiated by oral secretions of the herbivore. Processes at different levels of biological complexity occur at timescales ranging from minutes to years. In this review, we address plant-mediated interactions with multiple species of the associated insect community and their effects on community dynamics, and link these to the mechanistic effects that multiple attacks have on plant phenotypes.","ANNUAL REVIEW OF PLANT BIOLOGY ","en",2014,"Jan","The Netherlands","The Netherlands","10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937","http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A","phenotypic plasticity;trait-mediated interaction networks;phytohormones;systems biology;species interactions"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"The ecology and evolution of plant tolerance to herbivory.","Strauss, Sharon Y.","Agrawal, Anurag A.","The tolerance of plants to herbivory reflects the degree to which a plant can regrow and reproduce after damage from herbivores. Autoecological factors, as well as the influence of competitors and mutualists, affect the level of plant tolerance. Recent work indicates that there is a heritable basis for tolerance and that it can evolve in natural plant populations. Although tolerance is probably not a strict alternative to plant resistance, there could be inter- and intraspecific tradeoffs between these defensive strategies.","TRENDS IN ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION","en",1999,"May","USA","USA","10.1016/0169-5347(94)90180-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0169-5347(94)90180-5","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various","Various ","Ecology;Evolution;Plant biology;herbivory;compensation;overcompensation;male plant fitness;plant–insect interactions;resistance;costs of tolerance;costs of defense"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Investigations of the physiological and morphological changes that occur in plants in response to herbivore damage have identified several potential mechanisms of tolerance. However, it is unlikely that all physiological changes that occur following damage are tolerance mechanisms. Few studies have made direct comparisons between the expression of tolerance and the relative expression of putative mechanisms. I briefly review empirical evidence for some of the better-studied potential mechanisms, including increased photosynthetic activity, compensatory growth, utilization of stored reserves, and phenological delays. For each of these mechanisms I discuss reasons why the relationship between tolerance and these characters may be more complicated than it first appears. I conclude by discussing several empirical approaches, including herbivore manipulations, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, and selection experiments, that will further our understanding of tolerance mechanisms.","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY ","en",2000,"Jul","USA","USA","10.1023/a:1010881317261","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/a:1010881317261","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (review)","Various ","compensation;empirical approaches;herbivory;plant defense;plant–herbivore interaction;tolerance mechanisms "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Herbivory of an invasive slug in a model grassland community can be affected by earthworms and mycorrhizal fungi.","Raphaël Trouvé","Johann G. Zaller","Invasion of non-native species is among the top threats for the biodiversity and functioning of native and agricultural ecosystems worldwide. We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms-Annelida: Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-AMF, Glomerales). We hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites, AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 % (P < 0.001). Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community structure.","BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS ","en",2013,"Jun","Australia","Austria","10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-013-0827-1","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Autria","University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU)","Aboveground-belowground interactions;Gastropods;Invasive species;Lumbricidae;Neobiota;Plant-soil interactions;Soil ecology;Symbiotic fungi"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms increase plant production: A meta-analysis.","Jan Willem van Groenigen","Kees Jan van Groenigen","To meet the challenge of feeding a growing world population with minimal environmental impact, we need comprehensive and quantitative knowledge of ecological factors affecting crop production. Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ","en",2014,"Sep","The Netherlands","England","10.1038/srep06365","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06365","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","Agroecology;Ecosystem services "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

"The myriad plant responses to herbivores.","Linda L. Walling","Linda L. Walling","Plant responses to herbivores are complex. Genes activated on herbivore attack are strongly correlated with the mode of herbivore feeding and the degree of tissue damage at the feeding site. Phloem-feeding whiteflies and aphids that produce little injury to plant foliage are perceived as pathogens and activate the salicylic acid (SA)-dependent and jasmonic acid (JA)/ethylene-dependent signaling pathways. Differential expression of plant genes in response to closely related insect species suggest that some elicitors generated by phloem-feeding insects are species-specific and are dependent on the herbivore's developmental stage. Other elicitors for defense-gene activation are likely to be more ubiquitous. Analogies to the pathogen-incompatible reactions are found. Chewing insects such as caterpillars and beetles and cell-content feeders such as mites and thrips cause more extensive tissue damage and activate wound-signaling pathways. Herbivore feeding is not equivalent to mechanical wounding. Wound responses ape a part of the induced responses that accompany herbivore feeding. Herbivores induce direct defenses that interfere with herbivore feeding, growth and development, fecundity, and fertility. In addition, herbivores induce an array of volatiles that creates an indirect mechanism of defense. Volatile blends provide specific cues to attract herbivore parasites and predators to infested plants. The nature of the elicitors for volatile production is discussed.","JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION ","en",2000,"Jun","USA","USA","10.1007/s003440000026","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003440000026","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","phloem-feeding insects;jasmonic acid;pathogenesis-related proteins;ethylene;saliva;signal transduction;salicylic acid;defense;chewing insects;wounding"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Domestication impacts on plant-herbivore interactions: A meta-analysis.","Susan R. Whitehead","Katja Poveda","For millennia, humans have imposed strong selection on domesticated crops, resulting in drastically altered crop phenotypes compared with wild ancestors. Crop yields have increased, but a long-held hypothesis is that domestication has also unintentionally decreased plant defences against herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis comparing insect herbivore resistance and putative plant defence traits between crops and their wild relatives. Our database included 2098 comparisons made across 73 crops in 89 studies. We found that domestication consistently reduced plant resistance to herbivores, although the magnitude of the effects varied across plant organs and depended on how resistance was measured. However, domestication had no consistent effects on the specific plant defence traits underlying resistance, including secondary metabolites and physical feeding barriers. The values of these traits sometimes increased and sometimes decreased during domestication. Consistent negative effects of domestication were observed only when defence traits were measured in reproductive organs or in the plant organ that was harvested. These results highlight the complexity of evolution under domestication and the need for an improved theoretical understanding of the mechanisms through which agronomic selection can influence the species interactions that impact both the yield and sustainability of our food systems.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences’.","PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2017,"Jan","USA","USA","10.1098/rstb.2016034","https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0034","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","agronomic selection;crop yield;herbivore resistance;plant defence theory;resource allocation;secondary metabolites"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Effects of earthworms on above- and below-ground herbivores.","Susanne Wurst","Susanne Wurst","Earthworms affect plant performance and can influence plant–herbivore interactions. Both primary and secondary metabolites and the expression of stress-responsive genes of plants can be affected by earthworms. Plant-mediated effects of earthworms on aboveground herbivore performance range between positive and negative. These indirect, plant-mediated effects likely depend on the altered resource uptake of plants or changes in the soil microbial community composition in presence of earthworms. Studies on belowground interactions between earthworms and root herbivores focussed almost exclusively on root-feeding nematodes. These interactions can be either direct (e.g. ingesting of nematodes) or indirect, mediated by changes in host plant performance or biotic and abiotic soil characteristics. Earthworms were documented to counteract the negative effects of root-feeding nematodes on plants. Consistently, earthworm-worked soils (vermicompost) have been reported to reduce numbers of root-feeding nematodes and plant damage by aboveground herbivores. The results suggest context dependent impacts of earthworms on herbivore performance and an alleviation of herbivore damage of plants by earthworms, besides their well-known effects on plant growth.

Detritivorous soil fauna, though ubiquitous and present in high abundances and biomasses in soil, are under-represented in those studies. Understanding of their impact on plants is mainly restricted to growth and nutrient uptake parameters. Detritivores have been shown to affect secondary metabolites and defense gene expression in aboveground parts of plants, with potential impacts on aboveground plant-herbivore interactions. The proposed mechanisms range from nutrient mobilization effects and impacts on soil microorganisms to defense induction by passive or active ingestion of roots. Since their negative effects (disruption or direct feeding of roots) may be counterbalanced by their overall beneficial effects (nutrient mobilization), detritivores may not harm, but rather enable plants to respond to aboveground herbivore attacks in a more efficient way. Both more mechanistic and holistic approaches are needed to better understand the involvement of detritivores in plant-mediated above-belowground interactions and their potential for sustainable agriculture.","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE ","en",2013,"Sep","Germany","Germany","10.3389/fpls.20130380","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2013.00380","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (review)","Various","above-belowground interactions;earthworms;Collembola;microorganisms;herbivores;defense;priming"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Earthworms counterbalance the negative effect of microorganisms on plant diversity and enhance the tolerance of grasses to nematodes.","Susanne Wurst","Wim H. Van Der Putten","Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non‐leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, butLotus corniculatusflowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant‐feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities.","OIKOS ","en",2008,"May","Germany","The Netherlands","10.1111/j030-1299.2008.16333.x","https://www.jstor.org/stable/40235358","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","The Netherlands","Mossel","Keywords +;GROUND INSECT HERBIVORY;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;SOIL;SUCCESSION;PERFORMANCE;LUMBRICIDAE;DETERMINANT;COLLEMBOLA"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."

Earthworms did not affect VAM root colonization. Earthworms enhanced shoot biomass, and VAM reduced root biomass. VAM increased plant phosphorus content, but reduced the total amount of N in leaves. Earthworms led to a preferential uptake of soil N compared with N-15 from the added grass residues in the absence of VAM. Earthworm presence reduced the concentration of catalpol. Earthworms and VAM combined accelerated the development of M. persicae, while the development tended to be delayed when only VAM or earthworms were present.

The magnitude of the effects of earthworms and organic litter distribution differed between the plant species, indicating different responses of plants with contrasting root morphology.

"Earthworms affect plant growth and resistance against herbivores: A meta-analysis.","Zhenggao Xiao","Sergio Rasmann","Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities.

We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.A plain language  is available for this article.","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","en",2017,"Nov","China","Switzerland","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12969","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Various (meta-analysis)","Various","chemical defences;detritivore diversity;endogeic earthworms;herbivore-feeding guilds;meta-analysis;plant growth-defence trade-off;plant nutrients;plant resistance"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Deposition and decomposition of cattle dung and its impact on soil properties and plant growth in a cool-temperate pasture.","Shinpei Yoshitake","Hiroshi Koizumi","Livestock dung provides an important direct pathway by which carbon and nutrients enter soils in pasture ecosystems and affects carbon and nitrogen cycling indirectly through changes in soil and plant properties. Here, we quantify dung deposition, decomposition, and the effects of dung on soil and plants in a Zoysia japonica grassland in Japan. We determined (1) the distribution of dung, (2) the mass loss rate of dung and the amount of carbon respired as CO2, and (3) changes in soil properties and aboveground biomass of Z. japonica. Dung deposition was 4–9.7 g C and 0.4–1 g N m−2 yea−1 and distributed patchily (Morishita's Iδ &gt; 1). Most (71 %) of the carbon in dung deposited in June was lost within a single grazing period by aerobic decomposition, more than mass loss rate of Z. japonica litter in the first year (about 50 %), suggesting that grazing and defecation can accelerate carbon cycling compared with the typical litterfall–decomposition regime. Nitrogen in dung mass entered the soil as ammonium nitrogen and was nitrified. The spatiotemporal distribution of these processes corresponded to that of stimulated Z. japonica growth. These results suggested that dung deposition significantly affected the inorganic nitrogen status of soil and, therefore, the growth of Z. japonica. However, these effects were very restricted temporally (July–August) and spatially (within 10 cm from dung edge). Thus, such spatiotemporally restricted effects combined with the patchy distribution of dung may contribute to the heterogeneous structure of pasture ecosystems.","ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH","en",2014,"Jul","Japan","Japan","10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","Japan","36°08′N, 137°25′E, about 1300–1350 m","Carbon and nitrogen cycling;Dung decomposition;Grassland;Pasture;Plant growth"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Mechanisms and evolution of plant resistance to aphids.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Aphids are important herbivores of both wild and cultivated plants. Plants rely on unique mechanisms of recognition, signalling and defence to cope with the specialized mode of phloem feeding by aphids. Aspects of the molecular mechanisms underlying aphid-plant interactions are beginning to be understood. Recent advances include the identification of aphid salivary proteins involved in host plant manipulation, and plant receptors involved in aphid recognition. However, a complete picture of aphid-plant interactions requires consideration of the ecological outcome of these mechanisms in nature, and the evolutionary processes that shaped them. Here we identify general patterns of resistance, with a special focus on recognition, phytohormonal signalling, secondary metabolites and induction of plant resistance. We discuss how host specialization can enable aphids to co-opt both the phytohormonal responses and defensive compounds of plants for their own benefit at a local scale. In response, systemically induced resistance in plants is common and often involves targeted responses to specific aphid species or even genotypes. As co-evolutionary adaptation between plants and aphids is ongoing, the stealthy nature of aphid feeding makes both the mechanisms and outcomes of these interactions highly distinct from those of other herbivore-plant interactions.","NATURE PLANTS ","en",2016,"Jan","Switzerland","USA","10.1038/nplants.2015.206","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nplants.2015.206","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A","N/A ","Jasmonic acid;Plant ecology;Plant evolution;Secondary metabolism;Structural variation "," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Trade-offs between plant growth and defense against insect herbivory: An emerging mechanistic synthesis.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Costs of defense are central to our understanding of interactions between organisms and their environment, and defensive phenotypes of plants have long been considered to be constrained by trade-offs that reflect the allocation of limiting resources. Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory “decisions” by the plant, enabling it to fine-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth–defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant's allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs.

"Using knockout mutants to reveal the growth costs of defensive traits.","Tobias Züst","Lindsay A. Turnbull","We used a selection of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with knockouts in defence genes to demonstrate growth costs of trichome development and glucosinolate production. Four of the seven defence mutants had significantly higher size-standardized growth rates (SGRs) than the wild-type in early life, although this benefit declined as plants grew larger. SGR is known to be a good predictor of success under high-density conditions, and we confirmed that mutants with higher growth rates had a large advantage when grown in competition. Despite the lack of differences in flowering-time genes, the mutants differed in flowering time, a trait that strongly correlated with early growth rate. Aphid herbivory decreased plant growth rate and increased flowering time, and aphid population growth rate was closely coupled to the growth rate of the host plant. Small differences in early SGR thus had cascading effects on both flowering time and herbivore populations.","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES ","en",2011,"Sep","Switzerland","England","10.1098/rspb.2010.2475","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.2475","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","N/A ","N/A","herbivore defences;size-standardized growth rate;glucosinolates;trichomes;Arabidopsis"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
"Growth-defense tradeoffs for two major anti-herbivore traits of the common milkweed Asclepias syriaca.","Tobias Züst","Anurag A. Agrawal","Costs of plant defense are a key assumption in evolutionary ecology, yet their detection has remained challenging. Here we introduce a novel method for quantifying plant growth using the common milkweed Asclepias syriaca and repeated non‐destructive size measurements to experimentally test for costs of defensive traits. We estimated mechanistic components of plant growth (relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area and leaf‐mass ratio) at two levels of fertilization (high and low), and related them to production of toxic cardenolides and exudation of sticky latex. We found negative genetic correlations between cardenolides and growth (most strongly with net assimilation rate) at both nutrient levels. Additionally, plants varied in their cardenolide response to low nutrients, and genetic families maintaining higher cardenolide production at low nutrient availability suffered proportionally larger reductions in growth. In contrast, the amount of latex was positively correlated with plant growth. Because latex is instantly deployed from a plant‐wide system of pressurized laticifers, larger plants may simply exude proportionally more latex when damaged and thus plant size is likely to mask potential costs of latex synthesis. Unbiased quantification of mechanistic growth processes, coupled with the manipulation of nutrient or stress levels, is thus an effective approach to demonstrate allocation to defense and tradeoffs with growth, especially in long‐lived plant species.","OIKOS ","en",2015,"Oct","Switzerland ","USA","10.1111/oik2075","https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.02075","10.1111/1365-2435.12969","USA","Tompkins County, New York","Keywords +: PLANT DEFENSE;FITNESS COSTS;CARDENOLIDES;COEVOLUTION;COMPONENTS;RESISTANCE;EVOLUTION;PATTERNS;MODELS;RATES"," detritivore diversity; endogeic earthworms; herbivore-feeding guilds; meta-analysis; plant growth-defence trade-off; plant nutrients; plant resistance."
