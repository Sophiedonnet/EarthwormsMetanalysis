1,Soil chemistry turned upside down: a meta-analysis of invasive earthworm effects on soil chemical properties,Olga Ferlian,Nico Eisenhauer,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent studies have shown that invasive earthworms can dramatically reduce native biodiversity, both above and below the ground. However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta‐analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base‐rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapotranspiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta‐analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, for example, shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta‐analyses.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2020.0,Aug,Germany,Germany,10.1002/ecy.2936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2936

Brun,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Biodiversity is responsible for the provision of many ecosystem services; human well‐being is based on these services, and consequently on biodiversity. In soil, earthworms represent the largest component of the animal biomass and are commonly termed ‘ecosystem engineers’. This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate. The review aims to assist people involved in all aspects of land management, including conservation, agriculture, mining or other industries, to obtain a broad knowledge of earthworms and ecosystem services.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2013.0,No data,France,France,10.1111/ejss.12025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12025

Hendrix,Weixin Zhang,"<jats:p>Introduced exotic earthworms now occur in every biogeographic region in all but the driest or coldest habitat types on Earth. The global distribution of a few species (e.g., Pontoscolex corethrurus) was noted by early naturalists, but now approximately 120 such peregrine species are recognized to be widespread from regional to global scales, mainly via human activities. Species adapted to human transport and to colonization of disturbed habitats are most widespread and are the principal invasive species. We identify a number of endogenous and exogenous factors that may contribute to the successful establishment and spread of peregrine species. Quantification of these factors may help to determine why certain species become invasive while others do not. Recent advances in theory and modeling of biological invasions and in molecular techniques should prove fruitful in improving our understanding of invasive earthworms, as well as in predicting their impacts on ecosystems.</jats:p>",Annual Reviews,en,2008.0,Jan,30602;,China,10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173426,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.39.110707.173426

Rothstein,"<p>This chapter discusses the increased occurrence of publication bias in the scientific literature. Publication bias is associated with the inaccurate representation of the merit of a hypothesis or idea. A strict definition is that it occurs when the published literature reports results that systematically differ from those of all studies and statistical tests conducted; the result is that false conclusions are drawn. The chapter presents five main approaches used to either detect potential narrow sense publication bias or assess how sensitive the results of a meta-analysis are to the possible exclusion. These include funnel plots, tests for relationships between effect size and sample size using nonparametric correlation or regression, trim and fill method, fail-safe numbers, and model selection.</p>",Princeton University Press,No data,2013.0,No data,No data,No data,10.23943/princeton/9780691137285.003.0014,http://dx.doi.org/10.23943/princeton/9780691137285.003.0014
17,Resource stoichiometry and availability modulate species richness and biomass of tropical litter macro-invertebrates.,Malte Jochum,Ulrich Brose,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>
<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>High biodiversity and biomass of soil communities are crucial for litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems such as tropical forests. However, the leaf litter that these communities consume is of particularly poor quality as indicated by elemental stoichiometry. The impact of resource quantity, quality and other habitat parameters on species richness and biomass of consumer communities is often studied in isolation, although much can be learned from simultaneously studying both community characteristics.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Using a dataset of 780 macro‐invertebrate consumer species across 32 sites in tropical lowland rain forest and agricultural systems on Sumatra, Indonesia, we investigated the effects of basal resource stoichiometry (C:X ratios of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, S in local leaf litter), litter mass (basal resource quantity and habitat space), plant species richness (surrogate for litter habitat heterogeneity), and soil pH (acidity) on consumer species richness and biomass across different consumer groups (i.e. 3 feeding guilds and 10 selected taxonomic groups).</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>In order to distinguish the most important predictors of consumer species richness and biomass, we applied a standardised model averaging approach investigating the effects of basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and soil <jats:styled-content style=""fixed-case"">pH</jats:styled-content> on both consumer community characteristics. This standardised approach enabled us to identify differences and similarities in the magnitude and importance of such effects on consumer species richness and biomass.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Across consumer groups, we found litter mass to be the most important predictor of both species richness and biomass. Resource stoichiometry had a more pronounced impact on consumer species richness than on their biomass. As expected, taxonomic groups differed in which resource and habitat parameters (basal resource stoichiometry, litter mass, plant species richness and pH) were most important for modulating their community characteristics.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The importance of litter mass for both species richness and biomass indicates that these tropical consumers strongly depend on habitat space and resource availability. Our study supports previous theoretical work indicating that consumer species richness is jointly influenced by resource availability and the balanced supply of multiple chemical elements in their resources.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

18,Biogeochemistry and the structure of tropical brown food webs.,Michael Kaspari,Stephen P. Yanoviak,"<jats:p>Litter invertebrates are notoriously patchy at small scales. Here we show that the abundance of 10 litter taxa also varies 100‐fold at landscape and regional scales across 26 forest stands in Peru and Panama. We contrast three hypotheses that link gradients of abundance to ecosystem biogeochemistry. Of 14 factors considered (12 chemical elements, plus fiber and litter depth), four best predicted the abundance of litter invertebrates. In the Secondary Productivity Hypothesis, phosphorus limits abundance via the conversion of detritus to microbial biomass. Two of four microbivore taxa, collembola and isopods, increased with the percentage of P (%P) of decomposing litter. However, percentage of S (correlated with %P) best predicted the abundance of collembola, oribatids, and diplopods (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.38, 0.33, 0.21, respectively). In the Structural Elements Hypotheses, N and Ca limit the abundance of silk‐spinning and calcareous taxa, respectively. Mesostigmatids, pseudoscorpions, and spiders, all known to make silk, each increased with percentage of N of litter (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.22, 0.31, 0.26, respectively). Calcareous isopods, but not diplopods, increased with percentage of Ca of litter (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.59). In the Ecosystem Size Hypothesis, top predators are limited by available space. The abundance of the three remaining predators, chilopods, staphylinids, and ants, increased with litter depth (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.31, 0.74, 0.69, respectively), and food webs from forests with deeper litter supported a higher ratio of predators to microbivores. These results suggest that biogeochemical gradients can provide a mechanism, through stoichiometry and trophic theory, shaping the geography of community structure.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2009.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1890/08-1795.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1795.1

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

 plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient
 retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of
 biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with
 interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models
 show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously
 influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies
 greatly among the models. This theory reinforces recent experimental
 results and shows that effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning

While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests. Changing plant functional composition in these forests may have long‐lasting effects on ecosystem functioning.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2016.0,Mar,Germany,Germany,10.1111/gcb.13446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13446

The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by <jats:italic>Lumbricus terrestris</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>L. rubellus</jats:italic>). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the <jats:italic><jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. terrestris</jats:named-content></jats:italic> (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both <jats:italic>L. rubellus</jats:italic> (R) and T plots. After two years, 22.0% ± 5.4% of <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N than <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots.

The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio.

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Biological invasions pose a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across ecosystems. Invasions by ecosystem engineers, in particular, have been shown to have dramatic effects in recipient ecosystems. For instance, invasion by earthworms, a below‐ground invertebrate ecosystem engineer, in previously earthworm‐free ecosystems alters the physico‐chemical characteristics of the soil. Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have far‐reaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we present the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms and soil invertebrates based on 430 observations from 30 independent studies.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Our meta‐analysis shows a significant decline of the diversity and density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm invasion with anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm invasion effects on soil micro‐organisms were context‐dependent, such as depending on functional group richness of invasive earthworms and soil depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral soil layers, with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the mixing of soil layers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize microbial communities across soil layers.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen‐fixing bacteria are responsible for<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>5–20% (grassland and savannah) to 80% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free‐living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that<jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth.

53,Performance of the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and between-study heterogeneity.,Jaime L. Peters,Lesley Rushton,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The trim and fill method allows estimation of an adjusted meta‐analysis estimate in the presence of publication bias. To date, the performance of the trim and fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in a number of simulated meta‐analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta‐analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta‐analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between‐study heterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is no
publication bias. However, when publication bias is present the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta‐analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the presence of publication bias, when between‐study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various meta‐analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.

There were no consistent differences in community structures between unlined, artificial burrows and control soils during a 16‐wk incubation. In contrast, protozoan numbers were elevated throughout the experiment in LEAF and WORM. A succession of nematode abundances occurred in LEAF, with plant parasitic and Tylenchid nematode numbers peaking at 5 wk, followed by high bacterivorous and fungivorous nematode numbers. In WORM, bacterivorous nematode numbers and active bacterial biomass were elevated for 1 and 3 wk, respectively, before declining. Active fungal biomass increased in WORM, whereas fungivorous nematodes were inhibited in earthworm burrows. While litter incorporation appeared to accelerate the rate of trophic interactions in artificial burrows, the effects of earthworms appeared to transcend that of litter translocation into soil, with earthworms differentially selecting for particular food web dynamics.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2004.0,No data,02881,02881,10.2136/sssaj2004.1160,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.1160

However, research on the effects of species gains and losses has developed largely independently of one another.

In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes. Species gains and losses are both consequences and drivers of global change; thus, explicit integration of research on how both processes simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning is key to determining the response of the Earth system to current and future human activities.</jats:p>",American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),en,2011.0,Oct,Sweden.,Netherlands.,10.1126/science.1197479,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197479

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities. A number of recent studies have explored whether these changes caused by earthworms may in turn affect plant performance and resistance to herbivores, but no formal synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.</jats:p>
</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a meta‐analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.</jats:p>
</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.</jats:p>
</jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.</jats:p>

77,Role of earthworms in soil fertility maintenance through the production of biogenic structures.,Tunira Bhadauria,Krishan Gopal Saxena,"<jats:p>The soil biota benefits soil productivity and contributes to the sustainable function of all ecosystems. The cycling of nutrients is a critical function that is essential to life on earth. Earthworms (EWs) are a major component of soil fauna communities in most ecosystems and comprise a large proportion of macrofauna biomass. Their activity is beneficial because it can enhance soil nutrient cycling through the rapid incorporation of detritus into mineral soils. In addition to this mixing effect, mucus production associated with water excretion in earthworm guts also enhances the activity of other beneficial soil microorganisms. This is followed by the production of organic matter. So, in the short term, a more significant effect is the concentration of large quantities of nutrients (N, P, K, and Ca) that are easily assimilable by plants in fresh cast depositions. In addition, earthworms seem to accelerate the mineralization as well as the turnover of soil organic matter. Earthworms are known also to increase nitrogen mineralization, through direct and indirect effects on the microbial community. The increased transfer of organic C and N into soil aggregates indicates the potential for earthworms to facilitate soil organic matter stabilization and accumulation in agricultural systems, and that their influence depends greatly on differences in land management practices.

This review considers the contribution of earthworms to ecosystem services through pedogenesis, development of soil structure, water regulation, nutrient cycling, primary production, climate regulation, pollution remediation and cultural services. Although there has been much research into the role of earthworms in soil ecology, this review demonstrates substantial gaps in our knowledge related in particular to difficulties in identifying the effects of species, land use and climate. The review aims to assist people involved in all aspects of land management, including conservation, agriculture, mining or other industries, to obtain a broad knowledge of earthworms and ecosystem services.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2013.0,No data,France,France,10.1111/ejss.12025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ejss.12025

Here we demonstrate that the positive effect of earthworms on rice could be the result of a systemic effect on plant physiology. Moreover, this effect could improve tolerance to stressors such as parasitic nematodes. In a controlled experiment, an 82% decrease in the production of infested plants was suppressed when earthworms were present. Earthworms had no direct effect on nematode population size. In their presence, however, root biomass was not affected by nematodes and the expected inhibition of photosynthesis was suppressed. In the leaves, the expression of three stress‐responsive genes (coding for lipoxygenase, phospholipase D and cysteine protease) was modulated by the presence of belowground invertebrate activities. We document conflicting systemic effects of parasitic nematodes and beneficial earthworms, although we cannot precisely identify the mechanism involved. These results reveal the importance of non‐trophic belowground/aboveground interactions for plant health and response to stresses.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2005.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00711.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00711.x

Firstly, stylet penetration activities were monitored with the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) technique and subsequently analysed using flow charts combined with correspondence analysis. Plant resistance was shown to be associated with repeated penetrations without access to either the xylem or the phloem, and with numerous failures in starting a sustained sap ingestion (as represented by pattern E2). Access to sieve elements of the phloem did not seem to be much affected on resistant plants but it took the aphid three times as long to produce a sap ingestion pattern when maintained on the resistant line <jats:italic>T. monococcum</jats:italic> n ° 44 (Tm44) as compared with aphids maintained on susceptible plants. As a result the total time spent in ingesting from sieve elements was reduced by 72% on Tm44. Secondly, direct observations of freely‐moving apterous adults were performed. Aphids did not discriminate between resistant and susceptible wheat during the first 30 min of access to test leaves, but only 4 out of 25 aphids were still probing after eight hours on resistant Tm44.</jats:p><jats:p>The relevance of these results to possible location of the resistance factor(s) are discussed.

Resource availability in the environment is proposed as the major determinant of both the amount and type of plant defense. When resources are limited, plants with inherently slow growth are favored over those with fast growth rates; slow rates in turn favor large investments in antiherbivore defenses. Leaf lifetime, also determined by resource availability, affects the relative advantages of defenses with different turnover rates. Relative limitation of different resources also constrains the types of defenses.

In the Mantaro Valley-Peru, it causes economic losses in cabbage and broccoli crops. Myzus persicae is the most important pest in potato cultivation. Myzaphis rosarum colonizes both wild and cultivated rose bushes and trees. To control it, farmers use toxic chemical insecticides that cause health problems. Faced with this problem, biocontrol is an important component of sustainable production to control pests. Hippodamia convergens is a predator of aphids, so it is necessary to know its biology and predation in its different prey. The objective was to determine the duration of the development stages, longevity, fecundity and performance of the predator H. convergens reared with cabbage aphids B. barssicae, Myzaphis rosarum and Myzus persicae. The completely randomized design was used, with 10 repetitions and three treatments or species of aphids. The aphid species used as food for the predator influenced the duration of preimaginal and adult development. Egg-adult development was longer with 34.1 days with B. brassicae and shorter with M. rosarum and M. persicae with 22.8 and 22.5 days respectively. Cabbage glucosinolates absorbed by B. barssicae negatively affected the growth rate, development, weight gain, survival, fecundity and predation capacity of H. convergens.</jats:p>",Universidad Nacional de Trujillo,No data,2022.0,No data,No data,No data,10.17268/agroind.sci.2022.03.01,http://dx.doi.org/10.17268/agroind.sci.2022.03.01

103,Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) feeding on Arabidopsis induces the formation of a deterrent indole glucosinolate.,Jae Hak Kim,Georg Jander,"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Cruciferous plants produce a wide variety of glucosinolates as a protection against herbivores and pathogens. However, very little is known about the importance of individual glucosinolates in plant defense and the regulation of their production in response to herbivory. When <jats:italic>Myzus persicae</jats:italic> (green peach aphid) feeds on Arabidopsis aliphatic glucosinolates pass through the aphid gut intact, but indole glucosinolates are mostly degraded. Although aphid feeding causes an overall decrease in Arabidopsis glucosinolate content, the production of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is induced. This altered glucosinolate profile is not a systemic plant response, but is limited to the area in which aphids are feeding. Aphid feeding on detached leaves causes a similar change in the glucosinolate profile, demonstrating that glucosinolate transport is not required for the observed changes. Salicylate‐mediated signaling has been implicated in other plant responses to aphid feeding. However, analysis of <jats:italic>eds5</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>pad4</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>npr1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>NahG</jats:italic> transgenic Arabidopsis, which are compromised in this pathway, demonstrated that aphid‐induced changes in the indole glucosinolate profile were unaffected. The addition of purified indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate to the petioles of <jats:italic>cyp79B2 cyp79B3</jats:italic> mutant leaves, which do not produce indole glucosinolates, showed that this glucosinolate serves as a precursor for the aphid‐induced synthesis of 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. In artificial diets, 4‐methoxyindol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate is a significantly greater aphid deterrent in the absence of myrosinase than its metabolic precursor indol‐3‐ylmethylglucosinolate. Together, these results demonstrate that, in response to aphid feeding, Arabidopsis plants convert one indole glucosinolate to another that provides a greater defensive benefit.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2007.0,Jul,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1365-313x.2006.03019.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313x.2006.03019.x

105,Effects of mycorrhizal fungi on insect herbivores: A meta-analysis.,Julia Koricheva,Tara Jones,"<jats:p>Mycorrhizal status of the host plant is often ignored in studies on plant–herbivore interactions, but mycorrhizal colonization is known to induce many morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in host plants, which in turn may alter plant quality as a host for insect herbivores. Both positive and negative effects of mycorrhizal colonization of the host plant on performance and density of insect herbivores have been reported in previous studies. We have conducted a meta‐analysis of 34 published and unpublished studies on this topic in order to find out the sources of variation in mycorrhizae effects on insect herbivores. Effects of mycorrhizae on chewing insects depended upon the parameter measured and the degree of herbivore feeding specialization. Density and consumption of chewing insects were higher on mycorrhizal plants, but this did not lead to greater plant damage, presumably because herbivore survival tended to be lower on mycorrhizal plants. Mono‐ and oligophagous chewers benefited from mycorrhizal colonization of their host plants, whereas performance of polyphagous chewers was reduced on mycorrhizal plants. Among sucking insects, phloem feeders benefited from mycorrhizal infection, but performance of mesophyll feeders was lower on mycorrhizal plants. The type of mycorrhiza was not important for chewing insects, but performance of sucking insects was increased more by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) than by ectomycorrhizae (ECM). Among AM inoculation studies, the most commonly used fungal species,<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Glomus intraradices</jats:named-content>, tended to have a negative effect on chewer performance, whereas all other fungal species tended to have a positive effect. There was no significant difference in results between studies using inoculation and fungicides, field and laboratory studies, and published and unpublished studies. Mycorrhizal status of the host plant thus influences insect herbivore performance, but the magnitude and direction of the effect depend upon the feeding mode and diet breadth of the insect and the identity of fungi.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2009.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1890/08-1555.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1555.1

Bueno,"<jats:p>Rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.)–wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) farmers in India burn or remove residues to facilitate seedbed preparation. Incorporation of residues before planting of the next crop generally decreases yields due to N immobilization. Since a window of about 40 d is available between rice harvest and wheat planting, the effect of time of incorporation on rice residue decomposition and N mineralization–immobilization was studied in 1992–1993. The mass loss of residue was 25% for a 10‐d, 35% for a 20‐d, and 51% for a 40‐d decomposition period before wheat planting. Nitrogen release from residue ranged from 6 to 9 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> during the wheat season. The immobilization of urea N decreased when residue was allowed to decompose for 10‐d or longer. Based on these studies, a long‐term (1993–2000) experiment was conducted on a sandy loam soil to examine the effect of time of residue incorporation before sowing wheat when compared with burning or removal of residue on yields, N‐use efficiency, and soil fertility. The effect of wheat residue incorporation with green manure (GM, <jats:italic>Sesbania cannabina</jats:italic> L.) on subsequent rice yields was also determined. Residue incorporation for 10 to 40 d had no effect on wheat yields. Rice yields increased (0.18–0.39 Mg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) when wheat residue was incorporated with GM. Starter N applied at residue incorporation did not influence wheat yields but decreased N recovery efficiency. Physiological efficiency was higher when rice straw was incorporated in wheat and when wheat straw plus GM were incorporated in rice than when rice straw was incorporated for 10 d or when the straw was burned. The long‐term application of rice residue increased C accumulation in soil.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2004.0,No data,India,Philippines,10.2136/sssaj2004.8540,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2004.8540

Wragg,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against consumers, leading to contrasting trade‐off possibilities. The competition‐defence hypothesis posits a trade‐off between competitive ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The growth‐defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500 species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance in species responses to both treatments provided support for a growth‐defence trade‐off: populations that increased with the removal of nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal of consumers. This result held globally across 4 years within plant life‐history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a growth‐defence trade‐off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2013.0,No data,USA,USA,10.1111/ele.12078,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12078

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Plants have a complex immune system that defends them against attackers (e.g. herbivores and microbial pathogens) but that also regulates the interactions with mutualistic organisms (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth‐promoting rhizobacteria). Plants have to respond to multiple environmental challenges, so they need to integrate both signals associated with biotic and abiotic stresses in the most appropriate response to survive.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Beneficial microbes such as rhizobacteria and mycorrhizal fungi can help plants to ‘deal’ with pathogens and herbivorous insects as well as to tolerate abiotic stress. Therefore, beneficial microbes may play an important role in a changing environment, where abiotic and biotic stresses on plants are expected to increase. The effects of beneficial microbes on herbivores are highly context‐dependent, but little is known on what is driving such dependency. Recent evidence shows that abiotic stresses such as changes in soil nutrients, drought and salt stress, as well as ozone can modify the outcome of plant–microbe–insect interactions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here, we review how abiotic stress can affect plant–microbe, plant–insect and plant–microbe–insect interactions, and the role of the network of plant signal‐transduction pathways in regulating such interactions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>Most of the studies on the effects of abiotic stress on plant–microbe–insect interactions show that the effects of microbes on herbivores (positive or negative) are strengthened under stressful conditions. We propose that, at least in part, this is due to the crosstalk of the different plant signalling pathways triggered by each stress individually. By understanding the cross‐regulation mechanisms we may be able to predict the possible outcomes of plant‐microbe–insect interactions under particular abiotic stress conditions. We also propose that microbes can help plants to deal with insects mainly under conditions that compromise efficient activation of plant defences.</jats:p></jats:list-item>
<jats:list-item><jats:p>In the context of global change, it is crucial to understand how abiotic stresses will affect species interactions, especially those interactions that are beneficial for plants. The final aim of this review is to stimulate studies unravelling when these ‘beneficial’ microbes really benefit a plant.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

               <jats:p>Half of all insect species are dependent on living plant tissues, consuming about 10% of plant annual production in natural habitats and an even greater percentage in agricultural systems, despite sophisticated control measures. Plants are generally remarkably well-protected against insect attack, with the result that most insects are highly specialized feeders. The mechanisms underlying plant resistance to invading herbivores on the one side, and insect food specialization on the other, are the main subjects of this book. For insects these include food-plant selection and the complex sensory processes involved, with their implications for learning and nutritional physiology, as well as the endocrinological aspects of life cycle synchronization with host plant phenology. In the case of plants exposed to insect herbivores, they include the activation of defence systems in order to minimize damage, as well as the emission of chemical signals that may attract natural enemies of the invading herbivores and may be exploited by neighbouring plants that mount defences as well.</jats:p>",Oxford University PressOxford,No data,2005.0,Jan,No data,No data,10.1093/oso/9780198525943.001.0001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198525943.001.0001

The dynamics of this community are critically influenced by the plant, which mediates interactions between community members that can occur on the plant simultaneously or at different times. Herbivory results in changes in the plant's morphological or chemical phenotype that affect interactions with subsequently arriving herbivores. Changes in the plant's phenotype are mediated by molecular processes such as phytohormonal signaling networks and transcriptomic rearrangements that are initiated by oral secretions of the herbivore. Processes at different levels of biological complexity occur at timescales ranging from minutes to years. In this review, we address plant-mediated interactions with multiple species of the associated insect community and their effects on community dynamics, and link these to the mechanistic effects that multiple attacks have on plant phenotypes.</jats:p>",Annual Reviews,en,2014.0,No data,Netherlands;,Netherlands;,10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-050213-035937

142,Domestication impacts on plant-herbivore interactions: A meta-analysis.,Susan R. Whitehead,Katja Poveda,"<jats:p>For millennia, humans have imposed strong selection on domesticated crops, resulting in drastically altered crop phenotypes compared with wild ancestors. Crop yields have increased, but a long-held hypothesis is that domestication has also unintentionally decreased plant defences against herbivores. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis comparing insect herbivore resistance and putative plant defence traits between crops and their wild relatives. Our database included 2098 comparisons made across 73 crops in 89 studies. We found that domestication consistently reduced plant resistance to herbivores, although the magnitude of the effects varied across plant organs and depended on how resistance was measured. However, domestication had no consistent effects on the specific plant defence traits underlying resistance, including secondary metabolites and physical feeding barriers. The values of these traits sometimes increased and sometimes decreased during domestication. Consistent negative effects of domestication were observed only when defence traits were measured in reproductive organs or in the plant organ that was harvested. These results highlight the complexity of evolution under domestication and the need for an improved theoretical understanding of the mechanisms through which agronomic selection can influence the species interactions that impact both the yield and sustainability of our food systems.</jats:p>

145,Earthworms counterbalance the negative effect of microorganisms on plant diversity and enhance the tolerance of grasses to nematodes.,Susanne Wurst,Wim H. Van Der Putten,"<jats:p>Plant community composition is affected by a wide array of soil organisms with diverse feeding modes and functions. Former studies dealt with the high diversity and complexity of soil communities by focusing on particular functional groups in isolation, by grouping soil organisms into body size classes or by using whole communities from different origins. Our approach was to investigate both the individual and the interaction effects of highly abundant soil organisms (microorganisms, nematodes and earthworms) to evaluate their impacts on grassland plant communities. Earthworms increased total plant community biomass by stimulating root growth. Nematodes reduced the biomass of grasses, but this effect was alleviated by the presence of earthworms. Non‐leguminous forb biomass increased in the presence of nematodes, probably due to an alleviation of the competitive strength of grasses by nematodes. Microorganisms reduced the diversity and evenness of the plant community, but only in the absence of earthworms. Legume biomass was not affected by soil organisms, but<jats:italic>Lotus corniculatus</jats:italic>flowered earlier in the presence of microorganisms and the number of flowers decreased in the presence of nematodes. The results indicate that earthworms have a profound impact on the structure of grassland plant communities by counterbalancing the negative effects of plant‐feeding nematodes on grasses and by conserving the evenness of the plant community. We propose that interacting effects of functionally dissimilar soil organisms on plant community performance have to be taken into account in future studies, since individual effects of soil organism groups may cancel out each other in functionally diverse soil communities.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2008.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16333.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16333.x

<jats:p>Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient availability through their burrowing and casting activities.

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a meta‐analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored ecological factors that might explain among‐studies variation in the magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.</jats:p>

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20%) and nitrogen content (by 11%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and rootworms), and even led to a 22% decrease in plant resistance against phloem‐feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence increased production of chemical defences by 31% when plants where attacked by cell‐feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81% increase in resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.</jats:p>

<jats:list-item>
<jats:p>These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of plant‐herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.</jats:p>

152,Deposition and decomposition of cattle dung and its impact on soil properties and plant growth in a cool-temperate pasture.,Shinpei Yoshitake,Hiroshi Koizumi,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Livestock dung provides an important direct pathway by which carbon and nutrients enter soils in pasture ecosystems and affects carbon and nitrogen cycling indirectly through changes in soil and plant properties. Here, we quantify dung deposition, decomposition, and the effects of dung on soil and plants in a <jats:italic>Zoysia japonica</jats:italic> grassland in Japan. We determined (1) the distribution of dung, (2) the mass loss rate of dung and the amount of carbon respired as CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and (3) changes in soil properties and aboveground biomass of <jats:italic>Z. japonica</jats:italic>. Dung deposition was 4.0–9.7 g C and 0.4–1.0 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and distributed patchily (Morishita's <jats:italic>I</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>δ</jats:italic></jats:sub> &gt; 1). Most (71 %) of the carbon in dung deposited in June was lost within a single grazing period by aerobic decomposition, more than mass loss rate of <jats:italic>Z. japonica</jats:italic> litter in the first year (about 50 %), suggesting that grazing and defecation can accelerate carbon cycling compared with the typical litterfall–decomposition regime. Nitrogen in dung mass entered the soil as ammonium nitrogen and was nitrified. The spatiotemporal distribution of these processes corresponded to that of stimulated <jats:italic>Z. japonica</jats:italic> growth. These results suggested that dung deposition significantly affected the inorganic nitrogen status of soil and, therefore, the growth of <jats:italic>Z. japonica</jats:italic>. However, these effects were very restricted temporally (July–August) and spatially (within 10 cm from dung edge). Thus, such spatiotemporally restricted effects combined with the patchy distribution of dung may contribute to the heterogeneous structure of pasture ecosystems.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2014.0,Mar,Japan,Japan,10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1153-2

154,Trade-offs between plant growth and defense against insect herbivory: An emerging mechanistic synthesis.,Tobias Züst,Anurag A. Agrawal,"<jats:p> Costs of defense are central to our understanding of interactions between organisms and their environment, and defensive phenotypes of plants have long been considered to be constrained by trade-offs that reflect the allocation of limiting resources. Recent advances in uncovering signal transduction networks have revealed that defense trade-offs are often the result of regulatory “decisions” by the plant, enabling it to fine-tune its phenotype in response to diverse environmental challenges. We place these results in the context of classic studies in ecology and evolutionary biology, and propose a unifying framework for growth–defense trade-offs as a means to study the plant's allocation of limiting resources. Pervasive physiological costs constrain the upper limit to growth and defense traits, but the diversity of selective pressures on plants often favors negative correlations at intermediate trait levels. Despite the ubiquity of underlying costs of defense, the current challenge is using physiological and molecular approaches to predict the conditions where they manifest as detectable trade-offs. </jats:p>",Annual Reviews,en,2017.0,No data,Switzerland;,14853;,10.1146/annurev-arplant-042916-040856,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042916-040856

            <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>
            mutants with knockouts in defence genes to demonstrate growth costs of trichome development and glucosinolate production. Four of the seven defence mutants had significantly higher size-standardized growth rates (SGRs) than the wild-type in early life, although this benefit declined as plants grew larger. SGR is known to be a good predictor of success under high-density conditions, and we confirmed that mutants with higher growth rates had a large advantage when grown in competition. Despite the lack of differences in flowering-time genes, the mutants differed in flowering time, a trait that strongly correlated with early growth rate. Aphid herbivory decreased plant growth rate and increased flowering time, and aphid population growth rate was closely coupled to the growth rate of the host plant. Small differences in early SGR thus had cascading effects on both flowering time and herbivore populations.

Agrawal,"<jats:p>Costs of plant defense are a key assumption in evolutionary ecology, yet their detection has remained challenging. Here we introduce a novel method for quantifying plant growth using the common milkweed <jats:italic>Asclepias syriaca</jats:italic> and repeated non‐destructive size measurements to experimentally test for costs of defensive traits. We estimated mechanistic components of plant growth (relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, specific leaf area and leaf‐mass ratio) at two levels of fertilization (high and low), and related them to production of toxic cardenolides and exudation of sticky latex. We found negative genetic correlations between cardenolides and growth (most strongly with net assimilation rate) at both nutrient levels. Additionally, plants varied in their cardenolide response to low nutrients, and genetic families maintaining higher cardenolide production at low nutrient availability suffered proportionally larger reductions in growth. In contrast, the amount of latex was positively correlated with plant growth. Because latex is instantly deployed from a plant‐wide system of pressurized laticifers, larger plants may simply exude proportionally more latex when damaged and thus plant size is likely to mask potential costs of latex synthesis. Unbiased quantification of mechanistic growth processes, coupled with the manipulation of nutrient or stress levels, is thus an effective approach to demonstrate allocation to defense and tradeoffs with growth, especially in long‐lived plant species.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2015.0,No data,USA,USA,10.1111/oik.02075,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.02075
157,The unseen invaders: introduced earthworms as drivers of change in plant communities in North American forests (a meta-analysis),Dylan Craven,Nico Eisenhauer,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity as well as ecosystem functioning. While less conspicuous than introduced aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta‐analysis using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and non‐native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined with increasing richness of introduced earthworm ecological groups. While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community composition: cover of graminoids and non‐native plant species significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic conditions of earthworm‐invaded forests. Further, our study provides evidence that introduced earthworms are associated with declines in plant diversity in North American forests. Changing plant functional composition in these forests may have long‐lasting effects on ecosystem functioning.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2016.0,Mar,Germany,Germany,10.1111/gcb.13446,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13446

C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire, herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors belowground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system.

Exotic plant species were most influenced by earthworms (lower seedling number but higher biomass), whereas natives were most sensitive to warming (higher seedling number). This differential response resulted in significant interaction effects of earthworms and warming on abundance and richness of native relative to exotic plants as well as related shifts in plant species composition. Structural equation modeling allowed us to address possible mechanisms: direct effects of earthworms primarily affected exotic plants, whereas earthworms and warming indirectly and differentially affected native and exotic plants through changes in soil water content and surface litter.</jats:p><jats:p>Invasive earthworms and warming are likely to interactively impact abiotic and biotic ecosystem properties.

Bohlen,"<jats:p>To examine the mechanisms of earthworm effects on forest soil C and N, we double‐labeled leaf litter with <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C and <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N, applied it to sugar maple forest plots with and without earthworms, and traced isotopes into soil pools. The experimental design included forest plots with different earthworm community composition (dominated by <jats:italic>Lumbricus terrestris</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>L. rubellus</jats:italic>). Soil carbon pools were 37% lower in earthworm‐invaded plots largely because of the elimination of the forest floor horizons, and mineral soil C:N was lower in earthworm plots despite the mixing of high C:N organic matter into soil by earthworms. Litter disappearance over the first winter–spring was highest in the <jats:italic><jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. terrestris</jats:named-content></jats:italic> (T) plots, but during the warm season, rapid loss of litter was observed in both <jats:italic>L. rubellus</jats:italic> (R) and T plots. After two years, 22.0% ± 5.4% of <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C released from litter was recovered in soil with no significant differences among plots. Total recovery of added <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C (decaying litter plus soil) was much higher in no‐worm (NW) plots (61–68%) than in R and T plots (20–29%) as much of the litter remained in the former whereas it had disappeared in the latter. Much higher percentage recovery of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N than <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C was observed, with significantly lower values for T than R and NW plots. Higher overwinter earthworm activity in T plots contributed to lower soil N recovery. In earthworm‐invaded plots isotope enrichment was highest in macroaggregates and microaggregates whereas in NW plots silt plus clay fractions were most enriched. The net effect of litter mixing and priming of recalcitrant soil organic matter (SOM), stabilization of SOM in soil aggregates, and alteration of the soil microbial community by earthworm activity results in loss of SOM and lowering of the C:N ratio. We suggest that earthworm stoichiometry plays a fundamental role in regulating C and N dynamics of forest SOM.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2013.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1890/12-1760.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1760.1

Warming will be accompanied by changes in above- and below-ground consumers: large moose (<jats:italic>Alces alces</jats:italic>) replaced by smaller deer (<jats:italic>Odocoileus virginianus</jats:italic>) above-ground, and small detritivores replaced by larger exotic earthworms below-ground. These shifts may induce a cascade of ecological impacts across trophic levels that could alter the boreal to temperate forest transition. Deer are more likely to browse saplings of temperate tree species, and European earthworms favour seedlings of boreal tree species more than temperate species, potentially hindering the ability of temperate tree species to expand northwards. We hypothesize that warming-induced changes in consumers will lead to novel plant communities by changing the filter on plant species success, and that above- and below-ground cascades of trophic interactions will allow boreal tree species to persist during early phases of warming, leading to an abrupt change at a later time.

REICH,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold><jats:italic>The invasion of non‐native earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) into a small number of intensively studied stands of northern hardwood forest has been linked to declines in plant diversity and the local extirpation of one threatened species. It is unknown, however, whether these changes have occurred across larger regions of hardwood forests, which plant species are most vulnerable, or with which earthworm species such changes are associated most closely. To address these issues we conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon national forests in Minnesota and Wisconsin (U.S.A.), respectively. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation, examined deer browse in 20 mature, sugar‐maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest, and analyzed the relationship between invasive earthworms and vascular plant species richness and composition. Invasion by Lumbricus was a strong indicator of reduced plant richness in both national forests. The mass of Lumbricus juveniles was significantly and negatively related to plant‐species richness in both forests. In addition, Lumbricus was a significant factor affecting plant richness in a full model that included multiple variables. In the Chequamegon National Forest earthworm mass was associated with higher sedge cover and lower cover of sugar maple seedlings and several forb species. The trends were similar but not as pronounced in Chippewa, perhaps due to lower deer densities and different earthworm species composition. Our results provide regional evidence that invasion by Lumbricus species may be an important mechanism in reduced plant‐species richness and changes in plant communities in mature forests dominated by sugar maples.</jats:italic></jats:p>",Wiley,en,2007.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00740.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00740.x
204,Regional extent of an ecosystem engineer: Earthworm invasion in northern hardwood forests.,Andrew R. Holdsworth,Peter B. Reich,"<jats:p>The invasion of exotic earthworms into northern temperate and boreal forests previously devoid of earthworms is an important driver of ecosystem change. Earthworm invasion can cause significant changes in soil structure and communities, nutrient cycles, and the diversity and abundance of herbaceous plants. However, the regional extent and patterns of this invasion are poorly known. We conducted a regional survey in the Chippewa and Chequamegon National Forests, in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to measure the extent and patterns of earthworm invasion and their relationship to potential earthworm introduction sites. We sampled earthworms, soils, and vegetation in 20 mature, sugar maple‐dominated forest stands in each national forest and analyzed the relationship between the presence of five earthworm taxonomic groups, habitat variables, and distance to the nearest potential introduction site. Earthworm invasion was extensive but incomplete in the two national forests. Four of the six earthworm taxonomic groups occurred in 55–95% of transects; however 20% of all transects were invaded by only one taxonomic group that has relatively minor ecological effects. Earthworm taxonomic groups exhibited a similar sequence of invasion found in other studies:<jats:italic>Dendrobaena</jats:italic>&gt;<jats:italic>Aporrectodea</jats:italic>=<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">Lumbricus</jats:named-content>juveniles &gt;<jats:named-content content-type=""genus-species"">L. rubellus</jats:named-content>&gt;<jats:italic>L. terrestris.</jats:italic>Distance to the nearest road was the best predictor of earthworm invasion in Wisconsin while distance to the nearest cabin was the best predictor in Minnesota. These data allow us to make preliminary assessments of landscape patterns of earthworm invasion. As an example, we estimate that 82% of upland mesic hardwood stands in the Wisconsin region are likely invaded by most taxonomic groups while only 3% are unlikely to be invaded at present. Distance to roads and cabins provides a coarse‐scale predictor of earthworm invasion to focus stand‐level assessments that will help forest managers better understand current and potential forest conditions and identify uninvaded areas that could serve as important refugia for plant species threatened by earthworm invasion.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2007.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1890/05-2003.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/05-2003.1

<jats:list>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The number of published meta‐analyses in plant ecology has increased greatly over the last two decades. Meta‐analysis has made a significant contribution to the field, allowing review of evidence for various ecological hypotheses and theories, estimation of effects of major environmental drivers (climate change, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, air pollution), assessment of management and conservation strategies, and comparison of effects across different temporal and spatial scales, taxa and ecosystems, as well as research gap identification.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We identified 322 meta‐analyses published in the field of plant ecology between 1996 and 2013 in 95 different journals and assessed their methodological and reporting quality according to standard criteria. Despite significant recent developments in the methodology of meta‐analysis, the quality of published meta‐analyses was uneven and showed little improvement over time.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found many cases of imprecise and inaccurate usage of the term ‘meta‐analysis’ in plant ecology, particularly confusion between meta‐analysis and vote counting and incorrect application of statistical techniques designed for primary studies to meta‐analytical data, without recognition of the violation of statistical assumptions of the analyses.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>Methodological issues for meta‐analyses in plant ecology include incomplete reporting of search strategy used to retrieve primary studies, failure to test for possible publication bias and to conduct sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the results, as well as lack of availability of the data set used for the analyses.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p>The use of meta‐analysis is particularly common in community ecology, ecophysiology and ecosystem ecology, but meta‐analyses in ecophysiology are more likely not to meet standard quality criteria than papers in other subdisciplines. Fewer meta‐analyses have been conducted in plant population ecology.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

<jats:list-item><jats:p><jats:italic>Synthesis</jats:italic>. Over the past two decades, plant ecologists have embraced meta‐analysis as a statistical tool to combine results across studies, and much has been learned as a result. However, as the popularity and usage of meta‐analysis in the field of plant ecology has grown, establishment of quality standards, as has been done in other disciplines, becomes increasingly important. In order to improve the quality of future meta‐analyses in plant ecology, we suggest adoption of a checklist of quality criteria for meta‐analysis for use by research synthesists, peer reviewers and journal editors.</jats:p></jats:list-item>

Romanuk,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is high uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of current and future biodiversity loss that is occurring due to human disturbances. Here, we present a global meta‐analysis of experimental and observational studies that report 327 measures of change in species richness between disturbed and undisturbed habitats across both terrestrial and aquatic biomes. On average, human‐mediated disturbances lead to an 18.3% decline in species richness. Declines in species richness were highest for endotherms (33.2%), followed by producers (25.1%), and ectotherms (10.5%). Land‐use change and species invasions had the largest impact on species richness resulting in a 24.8% and 23.7% decline, respectively, followed by habitat loss (14%), nutrient addition (8.2%), and increases in temperature (3.6%). Across all disturbances, declines in species richness were greater for terrestrial biomes (22.4%) than aquatic biomes (5.9%). In the tropics, habitat loss and land‐use change had the largest impact on species richness, whereas in the boreal forest and Northern temperate forests, species invasions had the largest impact on species richness.

217,Earthworm invasion as the driving force behind plant invasion and community change in northeastern North American forests.,VICTORIA A. NUZZO,BERND BLOSSEY,"<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold>  <jats:italic>Identification of factors that drive changes in plant community structure and contribute to decline and endangerment of native plant species is essential to the development of appropriate management strategies. Introduced species are assumed to be driving causes of shifts in native plant communities, but unequivocal evidence supporting this view is frequently lacking. We measured native vegetation, non‐native earthworm biomass, and leaf‐litter volume in 15 forests in the presence and absence of 3 non‐native plant species (</jats:italic>Microstegium vimineum, Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii<jats:italic>) to assess the general impact of non‐native plant and earthworm invasions on native plant communities in northeastern United States. Non‐native plant cover was positively correlated with total native plant cover and non‐native earthworm biomass. Earthworm biomass was negatively associated with cover of native woody and most herbaceous plants and with litter volume. Graminoid cover was positively associated with non‐native earthworm biomass and non‐native plant cover. These earthworm‐associated responses were detected at all sites despite differences in earthworm species and abundance, composition of the native plant community, identity of invasive plant species, and geographic region. These patterns suggest earthworm invasion, rather than non‐native plant invasion, is the driving force behind changes in forest plant communities in northeastern North America, including declines in native plant species, and earthworm invasions appear to facilitate plant invasions in these forests. Thus, a focus on management of invasive plant species may be insufficient to protect northeastern forest understory species.</jats:italic></jats:p>",Wiley,en,2009.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01168.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01168.x

            ) noted that studies showing large effects have tended to be focused on smaller spatial scales, while those showing smaller effects have usually been on broader spatial scales. For such a scale-dependent effect to occur, invasive species must alter the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR). Comparing the differences in SARs with invaded and uninvaded communities of plants in three different ecosystem types in the United States revealed smaller effects of invasive species on biodiversity at increasingly broader spatial scales. Empirical data and simulations suggested that the observed patterns result from disproportionately greater influences of invasive species on common relative to rare species that result from a combination of sampling effects and differential responses to invasion.

223,Ecosystem engineering effects on species diversity across ecosystems: a meta-analysis.,Gustavo Q. Romero,Julia Koricheva,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Ecosystem engineering is increasingly recognized as a relevant ecological driver of diversity and community composition. Although engineering impacts on the biota can vary from negative to positive, and from trivial to enormous, patterns and causes of variation in the magnitude of engineering effects across ecosystems and engineer types remain largely unknown. To elucidate the above patterns, we conducted a meta‐analysis of 122 studies which explored effects of animal ecosystem engineers on species richness of other organisms in the community. The analysis revealed that the overall effect of ecosystem engineers on diversity is positive and corresponds to a 25% increase in species richness, indicating that ecosystem engineering is a facilitative process globally. Engineering effects were stronger in the tropics than at higher latitudes, likely because new or modified habitats provided by engineers in the tropics may help minimize competition and predation pressures on resident species. Within aquatic environments, engineering impacts were stronger in marine ecosystems (rocky shores) than in streams. In terrestrial ecosystems, engineers displayed stronger positive effects in arid environments (e.g. deserts). Ecosystem engineers that create new habitats or microhabitats had stronger effects than those that modify habitats or cause bioturbation. Invertebrate engineers and those with lower engineering persistence (&lt;1 year) affected species richness more than vertebrate engineers which persisted for &gt;1 year. Invertebrate species richness was particularly responsive to engineering impacts. This study is the first attempt to build an integrative framework of engineering effects on species diversity; it highlights the importance of considering latitude, habitat, engineering functional group, taxon and persistence of their effects in future theoretical and empirical studies.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2014.0,No data,Brazil,U.K,10.1111/brv.12138,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12138

229,A consumer’s guide to evenness indices.,Hanna Tuomisto,Hanna Tuomisto,"<jats:p>Ecologists widely agree that species diversity consists of two components, richness (the number of species) and evenness (a measure of the equitability of the proportional abundances of those species). However, no consensus on an exact definition of evenness (or equitability) has emerged. Instead, numerous equitability indices have been used in the ecological literature, as different researchers have preferred indices with different mathematical properties. In this paper, I show that the phrase ‘species diversity consists of two independent components, richness and evenness’ logically leads to one particular definition of evenness (Evenness = Diversity/Richness). To facilitate accurate communication, I propose that the term ‘evenness’ be used only to refer to this phenomenon, and that other terms be used for the equitability indices that measure other things. Here I provide a review of popular equitability indices, explain what each measures in practice, and show how they relate to each other and to evenness itself. I also explore how the partitioning of diversity into richness and evenness components is related to the partitioning of diversity into alpha and beta components. Dissecting the indices makes it easier to see the conceptual differences among them. Such understanding is necessary to ensure that an appropriate index is chosen for the questions at hand, as well as to interpret the index values correctly and to assess when index values can and when they cannot be considered comparable.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2012.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19897.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19897.x

However, research on the effects of species gains and losses has developed largely independently of one another.

In contrast, studies on traits associated with species loss are fewer, and much remains unknown about how traits that predispose species to extinction affect ecological processes. Species gains and losses are both consequences and drivers of global change; thus, explicit integration of research on how both processes simultaneously affect ecosystem functioning is key to determining the response of the Earth system to current and future human activities.</jats:p>",American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS),en,2011.0,Oct,Sweden.,Netherlands.,10.1126/science.1197479,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197479

240,Food security: the challenge of feeding 9 billion people.,Donald L. Winkelmann,Donald L. Winkelmann,"<p>Most observers agree that, barring catastrophe, the global population will number more than 8 billion by 2025. There is, however, less agreement about the consequences for food security. Some, for example, Brown and Kane of the World Watch Institute (Brown and Kane, 1994), argue that there will be widespread shortages of foodstuffs, accompanied by higher global prices. Others, like Alexandratos of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Alexandratos, 1995), claim that production will match rising demands and that prices will continue to decline in real terms. All agree, however, that the world’s poor, especially those in the poorest countries, will be without adequate food. This chapter links food security with poverty and argues that increased productivity in agriculture is the most effective way for the poor to achieve food security. What is food security? The International Food Policy Research Institute, IFPRI (IFPRI, 1995) defines food security as “economic and physical access at all times to the food required for a healthy and productive life.” Food security has two dimensions: the availability of food and access to food. Availability depends on production, and, while the debate about global availability continues, the view in this chapter, like that of the FAO, is that adequate food will be available globally at real prices roughly comparable to those prevailing in the 1990s. (See Dyson, 1996, p. 167, for perhaps the latest systematic study holding this view.) To achieve food adequacy, the major assumptions here are that research will continue to turn out the elements of improved technologies and that Eastern Europe, especially Russia and Ukraine, will move closer to its potential as a food supplier. Lack of access to food because of poverty, however, is a major challenge. Some people in the developed world and in higher-income developing countries do not have access to food, but policy changes could resolve that problem; certainly, such societies have the resources. This is not the case for the poor in the world’s poorest countries; for them, the combination of individual and societal poverty severely limits access to adequate foodstuffs.</p>",Oxford University Press,No data,1998.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1093/oso/9780195113129.003.0028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780195113129.003.0028

246,"The role of biomass allocation in the growth response of plants to different levels of light, CO2, nutrients and water: a quantitative review.",Hendrik Poorter,Oscar Nagel,"<jats:p>The allocation of biomass to different plant
organs depends on species, ontogeny and on the environment experienced by the
plant. In this paper we first discuss some methodological tools to describe
and analyse the allocation of biomass. Rather than the use of shoot:root
ratios, we plead strongly for a subdivision of biomass into at least three
compartments: leaves, stems and roots. Attention is drawn to some of the
disadvantages of allometry as a tool to correct for size differences between
plants. Second, we tested the extent to which biomass allocation of plants
follows the model of a ‘functional equilibrium’. According to this
model, plants respond to a decrease in above-ground resources with increased
allocation to shoots (leaves), whereas they respond to a decrease in
below-ground resources with increased allocation to roots. We carried out a
meta-analysis of the literature, analysing the effect of various environmental
variables on the fraction of total plant biomass allocated to leaves (leaf
mass fraction), stem (stem mass fraction) and roots (root mass fraction). The
responses to light, nutrients and water agreed with the (qualitative)
prediction of the ‘functional equilibrium’ theory. The notable
exception was atmospheric CO2, which did not affect
allocation when the concentration was doubled. Third, we analysed the
quantitative importance of the changes in allocation compared to changes in
other growth parameters, such as unit leaf rate (the net difference between
carbon gain and carbon losses per unit time and leaf area), and specific leaf
area (leaf area: leaf biomass). The effects of light,
CO2 and water on leaf mass fractions were small compared
to their effects on relative growth rate. The effects of nutrients, however,
were large, suggesting that only in the case of nutrients, biomass allocation
is a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply.</jats:p>",CSIRO Publishing,en,2000.0,No data,No data,No data,10.1071/pp99173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/pp99173

            Rising levels of atmospheric CO

274,Assessing the effect of elevated carbon dioxide on soil carbon: A comparison of four meta-analyses.,BRUCE A. HUNGATE,CRAIG W. OSENBERG,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon (C) in the terrestrial biosphere and soil C has a relatively long mean residence time. Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) concentrations generally increase plant growth and C input to soil, suggesting that soil might help mitigate atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> rise and global warming. But to what extent mitigation will occur is unclear. The large size of the soil C pool not only makes it a potential buffer against rising atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, but also makes it difficult to measure changes amid the existing background. Meta‐analysis is one tool that can overcome the limited power of single studies. Four recent meta‐analyses addressed this issue but reached somewhat different conclusions about the effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on soil C accumulation, especially regarding the role of nitrogen (N) inputs. Here, we assess the extent of differences between these conclusions and propose a new analysis of the data. The four meta‐analyses included different studies, derived different effect size estimates from common studies, used different weighting functions and metrics of effect size, and used different approaches to address nonindependence of effect sizes. Although all factors influenced the mean effect size estimates and subsequent inferences, the approach to independence had the largest influence. We recommend that meta‐analysts critically assess and report choices about effect size metrics and weighting functions, and criteria for study selection and independence. Such decisions need to be justified carefully because they affect the basis for inference. Our new analysis, with a combined data set, confirms that the effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on net soil C accumulation increases with the addition of N fertilizers. Although the effect at low N inputs was not significant, statistical power to detect biogeochemically important effect sizes at low N is limited, even with meta‐analysis, suggesting the continued need for long‐term experiments.</jats:p>",Wiley,en,2009.0,Feb,No data,No data,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01866.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01866.x
